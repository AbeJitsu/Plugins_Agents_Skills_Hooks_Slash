  "principles": [
    "Refactoring should improve code quality without changing behavior",
    "Changes should be clear and well-justified",
    "Refactored code should be simpler and easier to understand",
    "Testing should verify behavior remains unchanged",
    "Incremental changes are better than massive rewrites"
  ],
  "validationRules": {
    "input": [
      "Existing code to be refactored",
      "Clear description of what needs improvement",
      "Why this refactoring is needed (readability, performance, maintainability)",

  "qualityCriteria": {
    "completeness": "Refactoring addresses all mentioned issues, results in cohesive improvement",
    "correctness": "Behavior unchanged, no bugs introduced, existing tests still pass",
    "consistency": "Refactored code follows same patterns as rest of codebase",
    "performance": "Performance improved or at least not degraded, improvements justified",
    "clarity": "Code is simpler and more readable, reasoning is clear",
    "maintainability": "Future changes to this code will be easier, code is more extensible"

  "commonPatterns": [
    "Extract repeated code into reusable functions",
    "Rename variables for clarity",

    "Refactoring that changes behavior",
    "Making code more complex while claiming improvement",
    "Ignoring existing test coverage",
    "Refactoring without understanding the code first",
    "Over-engineering or over-abstracting",
    "Changing coding style inconsistently",
    "Removing comments and documentation"
