  "principles": [
    "Tests should verify actual behavior, not implementation details",
    "Tests should be deterministic and not flaky",
    "Test names should clearly describe what is being tested",
    "Tests should be maintainable and follow established patterns",
    "Good test coverage reduces bugs and increases confidence in refactoring"
  ],
  "validationRules": {
    "input": [
      "Code that needs testing or test coverage to improve",
      "Clear description of what should be tested",
      "Expected behaviors or scenarios to cover",

  "qualityCriteria": {
    "completeness": "Happy path tested, edge cases covered, error cases covered, adequate coverage",
    "correctness": "Tests verify actual behavior, no false positives, assertions are correct",
    "consistency": "Test structure consistent, naming consistent, setup/teardown patterns consistent",
    "performance": "Tests run quickly, no unnecessary delays, can run in parallel if needed",
    "reliability": "Tests don't flake, not dependent on timing, isolated from each other",
    "maintainability": "Easy to understand what each test does, clear test data, easy to modify"
  },
  "commonPatterns": [
    "Test both happy path and edge cases",
    "Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested",
    "Use arrange-act-assert pattern",
    "Mock external dependencies",
    "Include setup and teardown when needed",
    "Test error handling and invalid inputs",
    "Aim for reasonable coverage (70-90% is good)"
  ],
  "antiPatterns": [
    "Testing implementation details instead of behavior",
    "Flaky tests that sometimes pass and sometimes fail",
    "Poor test names that don't explain what's tested",
    "Tests that depend on test execution order",
    "Not testing error cases",
    "Over-mocking making tests brittle",
    "Tests that are slower than the code they test"
