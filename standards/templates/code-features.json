    "Code should be readable and self-documenting",
    "Functionality should be correct and well-tested",

    "completeness": "All required functionality implemented, no partially-done features",
    "correctness": "Code runs without errors, handles edge cases, produces expected output",

    "performance": "Reasonable performance for typical use cases, no obvious inefficiencies",

  "commonPatterns": [
    "Include error handling and edge case coverage",
