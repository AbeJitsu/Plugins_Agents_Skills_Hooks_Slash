Within it one might include the construction industry, itself\noften considered our country's largest business. In addition, the real estate\nindustry may be said to include the creation, management, and demolition of\nevery residence and business facility in the nation: offices, warehouses, factories,\nstores, and special purpose buildings such as hospitals and government facilities.\nThe real estate business would include as well the managing of all the\nundeveloped land in the country: national parks, forests, and the vast quantity of\nunused federal property.\nReal estate professionals are individuals and business organizations whose sole\nenterprise is performing a real estate-related service or function. A wide range\nof professions is available to persons wishing to enter the real estate business.\nReal estate\nactivities Real estate professionals perform the following property-related functions:\n\uf034 creation and improvement\n\uf034 management and maintenance\n\uf034 demolition\n\uf034 investment ownership\n\uf034 regulation\n\uf034 transfer\nCreation and improvement. Creating real properties from raw land involves\ncapital formation, financing, construction contracting, and regulatory approvals.\nThe key parties involved in this aspect of the business are generally the\ndeveloper, the landowner, and the mortgage lender. Also involved are market\nanalysts, architects, engineers, space planners, interior designers, and\nconstruction subcontractors.\nChapter 1: The Real Estate Business 7",

    "text": "Experts who manage the legal aspects of the development project include real\nestate attorneys, title companies, surveyors, property insurance companies, and\ngovernment regulatory officials. The brokerage community, with the assistance\nof professional appraisers, usually handles the ownership and leasing\ntransactions that occur over the many phases of development.\nManagement and maintenance. All real estate, whether raw land or improved\nproperty, must be managed and maintained. The two principal types of\nmanagers are property managers and asset managers. Property managers and\ntheir staff oversee specific properties on behalf of the owners, making sure the\ncondition of the property and its financial performance meet specific standards.\nAsset managers oversee groups of properties, or portfolios. Their role is to\nachieve the investment objectives of the owners as opposed to managing day-\nto-day operations.\nMaintenance personnel include engineers, systems technicians, janitorial staff,\nand other employees needed to maintain the property's condition.\nDemolition. Demolition experts in conjunction with excavation and debris\nremoval experts serve to remove properties that are no longer economically\nviable from the market.\nInvestment ownership. A specialized niche in the real estate business is the\nreal estate investor who risks capital in order to buy, hold, and sell real\nproperties. In contrast to property owners whose primary interest is in some\nother business, the real estate investor focuses on identifying and exploiting real\nestate investment opportunities for profit. The real estate investor provides\ncapital and liquidity to the real estate market.\nRegulation. All real estate is to some degree regulated by government. The\nprincipal areas of regulation are usage, taxation, and housing administration.\nProfessional regulatory functions include public planners, zoning\nadministrators, building inspectors, assessors, and administrators of specific\nfederal statutes such as Federal Fair Housing Laws.\nTransfer. Rights and interests in real estate can be bought, sold, assigned,\nleased, exchanged, inherited, or otherwise transferred from one owner to\nanother. Real estate brokers and the brokers' salespeople are generally centrally\ninvolved in such transfers. Other professional participants are mortgage brokers,\nmortgage bankers, appraisers, insurers, and title companies.\n8 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Professional\nspecialties In summary, the six primary functional areas are populated by professionals with\nthe following specialties.\nExhibit 1.1 Professions in Real Estate\nCreating developers market analysts\npublic and private planners surveyors\narchitects engineers\nbuilding contractors public and private inspectors\nspace planners mortgage brokers\nmortgage lenders and bankers securities companies\ntitle and escrow companies attorneys\ninsurers appraisers\nreal estate brokers and agents\nManaging &\nMaintaining property managers asset managers\nmaintenance engineers maintenance\ntechnicians corporate managers\nDestroying demolition contractors excavators\nHolding investors corporate managers\nRegulating assessors public planners\nzoning administrators building inspectors\nTransferring brokers and agents appraisers\nlenders and bankers mortgage brokers\ntitle and escrow companies attorneys\ninsurers surveyors\nProperty type\nspecialization In addition to specializing by function, many professionals also specialize in the\ntype of property they work with. According to the purpose of ownership,\nproperties are classified as residential, commercial, or investment properties.\nResidential property refers to property that is owned and used for habitation.\nSuch properties may be further classified in terms of how many families they are\ndesigned to house, whether they are attached to other units or detached, and so\nforth.\nCommercial property generally refers to retail and office properties, but may\nalso include industrial real estate. The term \"commercial\" relates to the fact that\nthe property can potentially generate income from a business's usage.\nInvestment property refers to any property that is held by its owners for\ninvestment purposes. All classifications of property may be investment\nproperties. Generally, however, the term does not refer to owner-occupied\nresidences, even though such properties constitute an investment. Apartments,\ncondominiums, cooperatives, and single-family homes may be considered as\ninvestment property if non-occupants own the property for investment purposes.\nThese properties are also referred to as residential income properties.\nChapter 1: The Real Estate Business 9",

    "text": "Forms of\nspecialization In the modern brokerage environment, brokers and agents specialize along the\nfollowing lines:\n\uf034 property type\n\uf034 geographical area\n\uf034 type of transaction\n\uf034 type of client\n\uf034 type of relationship\nOne's choice of specialization is influenced by competitive factors in the market\nand by perceived opportunities.\nProperty type. Since different properties have different features and potential\nbuyers, brokers commonly choose to specialize in a property type. Thus there\nare:\n\uf034 residential agents\n\uf034 commercial agents (office, retail)\n\uf034 industrial agents\n\uf034 land agents\nGeographical area. Brokers and agents must maintain current, accurate data\non properties. It is not possible to keep track of every property in larger\nmarkets. Therefore, one must create an area of geographical specialization.\nOne's area may be defined by natural barriers; by streets and highways; or by a\ncertain set of subdivisions.\nType of transaction. The principal types of transaction are sales, leases\nand subleases, exchanges, and options.\nEach form of transaction involves particular legal documents and considerations.\nAs a result, many agents, particularly commercial agents, specialize in a type of\ntransaction. For example, in an urban commercial property market, agents\ngenerally specialize in either leases or sales.\nType of client. Brokers increasingly represent buyers and tenants as well as\nsellers and landlords. Since conflicts of interest may be involved, many brokers\nrestrict their business to representing either buyers and tenants or sellers and\nlandlords exclusively.\nSome brokers and agents also specialize according to the type of business\ntheir clients are in or their motivations for the transaction. Thus one finds\nbrokers who focus exclusively on hospitals, or fast food chains, or executive\nrelocations.\nType of relationship. In recent years, many brokers have specialized in\nproviding advisory services to clients instead of the traditional transaction-based,\ncommission-compensated services. In the advisory relationship, the broker works\non identified real estate tasks or projects in exchange for a fee, salary, or retainer.\nThe fee advisor may or may not focus on completing a transaction.\nChapter 1: The Real Estate Business 11",

For example, the\nNational Association of Realtors\u00ae Code of Ethics not only reflects the law but\nsets an even higher standard of performance for member brokers and agents.\nIt is imperative for new practitioners to understand and abide by the many laws\nwhich regulate the industry.\nReal estate\nlicense laws State real estate license laws comprise the primary body of laws and regulations\ngoverning real estate brokerage practice. License laws in each state specify who\nmust obtain a license to practice real estate and set the requirements for\nobtaining and maintaining the license. License laws also define critical aspects\nof real estate brokerage, including\n\uf034 procedures for handling escrow deposits and fees\n\uf034 procedures for advertising\n\uf034 guidelines for dealing with clients and customers\nState license laws are administered in each state by a real estate commission.\nThe commission is charged with administering and enforcing license laws.

Real estate in the United States may be owned privately by\nindividuals and private entities or publicly by government entities. Private\nownership rights in this country are not absolute. The government can impose\ntaxes and restrictions on private ownership rights, and it can take private\nproperty away altogether. In addition, other private parties can exert their rights\nand interests on one's real property. A bank, for example, can take a property if\nthe owner fails to pay a mortgage. A neighbor can claim the right to walk across\none's property whether the owner likes it or not, provided he or she has done so\nfor a certain number of years.\nIn attempting to define real estate, it is essential to understand what rights and\ninterests parties have in a parcel of real estate.

Land has three unique physical\ncharacteristics: immobility, indestructibility, and heterogeneity.\nLand is immobile, since a parcel of land cannot be moved from one site to\nanother. In other words, the geographical location of a tract of land is fixed and\ncannot be changed. One can transport portions of the land such as mined coal,\ndirt, or cut plants. However, as soon as such elements are detached from the\nland, they are no longer considered land.\nLand is indestructible in the sense that one would have to remove a segment of\nthe planet all the way to the core in order to destroy it. Even then, the portion\nextending upward to infinity would remain. For the same reason, land is\nconsidered to be permanent.\nLand is non-homogeneous, since no two parcels of land are exactly the same.\nAdmittedly, two adjacent parcels may be very similar and have the same\neconomic value. However, they are inherently different because each parcel has\na unique location.\nReal estate The legal concept of real estate encompasses:\n\uf034 land\n\uf034 all man-made structures that are\n\"permanently\" attached to the land\nReal estate therefore includes, in addition to land, such things as fences, streets,\nbuildings, wells, sewers, sidewalks and piers. Such man-made structures attached\nto the land are called improvements. The phrase \"permanently attached\" refers\nprimarily to one's intention in attaching the item. Obviously, very few if any\nmanmade structures can be permanently attached to the land in the literal sense.\nBut if a person constructs a house with the intention of creating a permanent\ndwelling, the house is considered real estate. By contrast, if a camper affixes a\ntent to the land with the intention of moving it to another camp in a week, the tent\nwould not be considered real estate.\nChapter 2: Rights in Real Estate 17",

    "text": "Exhibit 2.1 The Legal Concept of Land and Real Estate\nProperty In common understanding, property is something that is owned by someone. A\ncar is the property of Bill Brown if Bill Brown owns the car. If the item is not\nowned, it is not property. For example, if a car is abandoned and left to rust in the\ndesert, the car is no longer property, since no one claims ownership. Similarly,\nthe planet Jupiter is not property, since no one owns it.\nFrom a more technical standpoint, property is not only the item that is owned\nbut also a set of rights to the item enjoyed by the owner. These rights are\ncommonly known as the \"bundle of rights.\"\nExhibit 2.2 The Bundle of Rights\nIn owning property, one has the right to possess and use it as the law allows. The\nowner has the right to transfer ownership of the item (sell, rent, donate, assign, or\nbequeath). The owner may also encumber the item by mortgaging it as collateral\nfor debt. Finally, the owner has the right to exclude others from use of the item.\nIn the example of the car, when Bill Brown bought the car, the car became his\n18 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Our legal system recognizes two classifications of\nproperty: real property and personal property. Real property is ownership of\nreal estate and the bundle of rights associated with owning the real estate.\nPersonal property is ownership of anything which is not real estate, and the\nrights associated with owning the personal property item. Items of personal\nproperty are also called chattels or personalty.\nNote: since all real estate in the United States is owned by some person,\nprivate organization, or government entity, all real estate in the country is real\nproperty. Given that fact, this text will follow the customary practice of using\nthe two terms interchangeably and synonymously.\nTangible versus intangible property. Real and personal property may be further\ncategorized as tangible or intangible property. Tangible property is physical,\nvisible, and material. Intangible property is abstract, having no physical existence\nin itself, other than as evidence of one's ownership interest.\nExhibit 2.3 Tangible vs. Intangible Property\nTangible Intangible\nReal Property all types\nPersonal boat, car, jewelry stock certificate,\nProperty contract, patent\nAll real estate, by its physical nature, is tangible property. Personal property\nmay be tangible or intangible. Boats, jewelry, coins, appliances, computers, and\nart work are examples of tangible personal property. Stocks, copyrights, bonds,\ntrademarks, patents, franchises, and listing agreements are examples of\nintangible personal property.\nReal property rights Real property rights consist of the bundle of rights associated with owning a\nparcel of real estate. Foremost of these rights is the right of possession.\nThe right to use a property refers to the right to use it in certain ways, such as\nmining, cultivating, landscaping, razing, and building on the property. The right\nis subject to the limitations of local zoning and the legality of the use. One's\nright to use may not infringe on the rights of others to use and enjoy their\nproperty. For example, an owner may be restricted from constructing a large\npond on her property if in fact the pond would pose flooding and drainage\nhazards to the next door neighbor.\nThe right to transfer interests in the property includes the right to sell, bequeath,\nlease, donate, or assign ownership interests. An owner may transfer certain\nindividual rights to the property without transferring total ownership. Also, one\nmay transfer ownership while retaining individual interests. For example, a\nChapter 2: Rights in Real Estate 19",

    "text": "person may sell mineral rights without selling the right of possession. On the\nother hand, the owner may convey all rights to the property except the mineral\nrights.\nWhile all rights are transferrable, the owner can only transfer what the owner in\nfact possesses. A property seller, for example, cannot sell water rights if there\nare no water rights attached to the property.\nThe right to encumber the property essentially means the right to mortgage the\nproperty as collateral for debt. There may be restrictions to this right, such as a\nspouse's right to limit the degree to which a homestead may be mortgaged.\nThe right to exclude gives the property owner the legal right to keep others off\nthe property and to prosecute trespassers.\nThe bundle of real property rights also applies separately to the individual\ncomponents of real estate: the air, the surface, and the subsurface. An owner can,\nfor example, transfer subsurface rights without transferring air rights. Similarly,\nan owner can rent air space without encumbering surface or subsurface rights.\nThis might occur in a city where adjoining building owners want to construct a\nwalkway over a third owner's lot. Such owners would have to acquire the air\nrights for the walkway. If the city wants to construct a subway through the\nowner's subsurface, the city has to obtain the subsurface rights to do so.\nAn ordinary lease is a common example of the transfer of a portion of one's\nbundle of rights. The owner relinquishes the right to possess portions of the\nsurface, perhaps a building, in return for rent. The tenant enjoys the rights to\npossess and use the building over the term of the lease, after which these rights\nrevert to the landlord. During the lease term, the tenant has no rights to the\nproperty's subsurface or airspace other than what the building occupies. Further,\nthe tenant does not enjoy any of the other rights in the bundle of rights: he\ncannot encumber the property or transfer it. To a limited degree, the tenant may\nexclude persons from the property, but he may not exclude the legal owner.\nSurface rights. Surface rights apply to the real estate contained within the\nsurface boundaries of the parcel. This includes the ground, all natural things\naffixed to the ground, and all improvements. Surface rights also include water\nrights.\nAir rights. Air rights apply to the space above the surface boundaries of the\nparcel, as delineated by imaginary vertical lines extended to infinity. Since the\nadvent of aviation, air rights have been curtailed to allow aircraft to fly over\none's property, provided the overflights do not interfere with the owner's use and\nenjoyment of the property. The issue of violation of air rights for the benefit of\nair transportation is an ongoing battle between airlines, airports, and nearby\nproperty owners.\nSubsurface rights. Subsurface rights apply to land beneath the surface of the\nreal estate parcel extending from its surface boundaries downward to the center\n20 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",
