Sale and\nlease contracts and option agreements are used to transfer real estate interests\nfrom one party to another. Mortgage contracts and promissory agreements are\npart of financing real estate. Listing and representation contracts establish\nclient relationships and provide for compensation.\nIn order to work with real estate contracts, it is imperative first to grasp basic\nconcepts that apply to all contracts in general. These concepts provide a\nfoundation for understanding the specifics of particular types of real estate\ncontract.\nCONTRACT VALIDITY\nAND ENFORCEABILITY\nLegal status of contracts\nCriteria for validity\nValidity of a conveyance contract\nEnforcement limitations\nElectronic contracting\nA contract is an agreement between two or more parties who, in a \"meeting\nof the minds,\" have pledged to perform or refrain from performing some act.\nA valid contract is one that is legally enforceable by virtue of meeting certain\nrequirements of contract law. If a contract does not meet the requirements, it\nis not valid and the parties to it cannot resort to a court of law to enforce its\nprovisions.\nNote that a contract is not a legal form or a prescribed set of words in a\ndocument, but rather the intangible agreement that was made in \"the meeting\nof the minds\" of the parties to the contract.\nLegal status\nof contracts In terms of validity and enforceability, a court may construe the legal status of a\ncontract in one of four ways:\n\uf034 valid\n\uf034 valid but unenforceable\n\uf034 void\n\uf034 voidable\nValid. A valid contract is one which meets the legal requirements for\nvalidity. These requirements are explained in the next section.\n130 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "A valid contract that is in writing is enforceable within a statutory time period.\nA valid contract that is made orally is also generally enforceable within a\nstatutory period, with the exceptions noted below.\nValid but unenforceable. State laws declare that some contracts are enforceable\nonly if they are in writing. These laws apply in particular to the transfer of\ninterests in real estate. Thus, while an oral contract may meet the tests for\nvalidity, if it falls under the laws requiring a written contract, the parties will not\nhave legal recourse to enforce performance. An oral long-term lease and an oral\nreal estate sales contract are examples of contracts that may be valid but not\nenforceable.\nNote that such contracts, if valid, remain so even though not enforceable.\nThis means that if the parties fully execute and perform the contract, the\noutcome may not be altered.\nVoid. A void contract is an agreement that does not meet the tests for validity,\nand therefore is no contract at all. If a contract is void, neither party can enforce\nit.\nFor example, a contract that does not include consideration is void. Likewise,\na contract to extort money from a business is void. Void contracts and\ninstruments are also described as \"null and void.\"\nVoidable. A voidable contract is one which initially appears to be valid, but is\nsubject to rescission by a party to the contract who is deemed to have acted\nunder some kind of disability. Only the party who claims the disability may\nrescind the legal effect of the contract.\nFor example, a party who was the victim of duress, coercion, or fraud in\ncreation of a contract, and can prove it, may disaffirm the contract. However,\nthe disaffirmation must occur within a legal time frame for the act of rescission\nto be valid. Similarly, if the party who has cause to disaffirm the contract\nelects instead to perform it, the contract is no longer voidable but valid.\nA voidable contract differs from a void contract in that the latter does not require\nan act of disaffirmation to render it unenforceable.\nChapter 10 Fundamentals of Contract Law 131",

    "text": "Criteria for validity A contract is valid only if it meets all of the following criteria.\nExhibit 10.1 Contract Validity Requirements\nCompetent parties. The parties to a contract must have the capacity to\ncontract, and there must be at least two such parties. Thus, the owner of a\ntenancy for life cannot deed his interest to himself in the form of a fee simple,\nas this would involve only one party. Capacity to contract is determined by\nthree factors:\n\uf034 legal age\n\uf034 mental competency\n\uf034 legitimate authority\nDepending on state law, a contract involving a minor as a party may be either\nvoid or voidable. If the law allows a minor to contract, the contract will\ngenerally be voidable and the minor can disaffirm the contract.\nTo be mentally competent, a party must have sufficient understanding of the\nimport and consequences of a contract. Competency in this context is separate\nand distinct from sanity. Incompetent parties, or parties of \"unsound mind,\"\nmay not enter into enforceable contracts. The incompetency of a party may be\nruled by a court of law or by other means. In some areas, convicted felons may\nbe deemed incompetent, depending on the nature of the crime.\nDuring the period of one's incompetency, a court may appoint a guardian who\nmay act on the incompetent party's behalf with court approval.\nIf the contracting party is representing another person or business entity, the\nrepresentative must have the legal authority to contract. If representing another\nperson, the party must have a bona fide power of attorney. If the contracting\nparty is representing a corporation, the person must have the appropriate power\n132 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

If the contracting entity is a general partnership, any\npartner may validly contract for the partnership. In a limited partnership, only\ngeneral partners may be parties to a contract.\nMutual consent. Mutual consent, also known as offer and acceptance and\nmeeting of the minds, requires that a contract involve a clear and definite offer\nand an intentional, unqualified acceptance of the offer. In effect, the parties must\nagree to the terms without equivocation. A court may nullify a contract where\nthe acceptance of terms by either party was partial, accidental, or vague.\nValuable consideration. A contract must contain a two-way exchange of\nvaluable consideration as compensation for performance by the other party. The\nexchange of considerations must be two-way. The contract is not valid or\nenforceable if just one party provides consideration.\nValuable consideration can be something of tangible value, such as money or\nsomething a party promises to do or not do. For example, a home builder may\npromise to build a house for a party as consideration for receiving money from\nthe home buyer. Or, a landowner may agree not to sell a property as\nconsideration for a developer's option money. Also, valuable consideration can\nbe something intangible that a party must give up, such as a homeowner's\noccupancy of the house in exchange for rent. In effect, consideration is the price\none party must pay to obtain performance from the other party.\nValuable consideration may be contrasted with good consideration, or \"love and\naffection,\" which does not qualify as consideration in a valid contract. Good\nconsideration is something of questionable value, such as a child's love for her\nmother. Good consideration disqualifies a contract because, while one's love or\naffection is certainly valuable to the other party, it is not something that is\nspecifically offered in exchange for something else. Good consideration can,\nhowever, serve as a nominal consideration in transferring a real property interest\nas a gift.\nIn some cases, what is promised as valuable consideration must also be deemed\nto be sufficient consideration. Grossly insufficient consideration, such as\n$50,000 for a $2 million property, may invalidate a contract on the grounds that\nthe agreement is a gift rather than a contract. In other cases where there is an\nextreme imbalance in the considerations exchanged, a contract may be\ninvalidated as a violation of good faith bargaining.\nChapter 10 Fundamentals of Contract Law 133",

The content, promise, or intent of a contract must be lawful.\nA contract that proposes an illegal act is void.\nVoluntary, good faith act. The parties must create the contract in good faith\nas a free and voluntary act. A contract is thus voidable if one party acted\nunder duress, coercion, fraud, or misrepresentation.\nFor example, if a property seller induces a buyer to purchase a house based on\nassurances that the roof is new, the buyer may rescind the agreement if the roof\nturns out to be twenty years old and leaky.\nValidity of a\nconveyance\ncontract In addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements, a contract that conveys\nan interest in real estate must:\n\uf034 be in writing\n\uf034 contain a legal description of the property\n\uf034 be signed by one or more of the parties\nA lease contract that has a term of one year or less is an exception.

Certain other\ncontracts which are valid may not be enforceable due to the statute of\nfrauds.\nStatute of limitations. The statute of limitations restricts the time period for\nwhich an injured party in a contract has the right to rescind or disaffirm the\ncontract.

All other contracts to buy, sell, exchange, or\nlease interests in real property must be in writing to be enforceable. In\naddition, listing agreements in most states must be in writing.\nThe statute of frauds concerns the enforceability of a contract, not its validity.\nOnce the parties to a valid oral contract have executed and performed it, even\nif the contract was unenforceable, a party cannot use the Statute of Frauds to\nrescind the contract.\nFor example, a broker and a seller have an oral agreement. Following the\nterms of the agreement, the broker finds a buyer, and the seller pays the\ncommission. They have now executed the contract, and the seller cannot later\nforce the broker to return the commission based on the statute of frauds.\nElectronic\ncontracting Contracting electronically through email and fax greatly facilitates the\ncompletion of transactions. Clients, lenders, title agents, inspectors, brokers,\nand other participants in a transaction can quickly share documentation and\ninformation. Electronic contracting is made possible by the Uniform\nElectronic Transactions Act (UETA) and the Electronic Signatures in Global\nand National Commerce Act (E-Sign), which are federal laws. UETA, which\nhas been accepted in most states, provides that electronic records and\nsignatures are legal and must be accepted. E-Sign makes contracts, records,\nand signatures legally enforceable, regardless of medium, even where UETA\nis not accepted.\nCONTRACT CREATION\nOffer and acceptance\nCounteroffer\nRevocation of an offer\nTermination of an offer\nAssignment of a contract\nContract preparation\nOffer and\nacceptance The mutual consent required for a valid contract is reached through the\nprocess of offer and acceptance: The offeror proposes contract terms in an\noffer to the offeree.

The exact point at which the offer becomes a\ncontract is when the offeree gives the offeror notice of the acceptance.\nChapter 10 Fundamentals of Contract Law 135",

    "text": "Exhibit 10.3 Offer, Counter Offer and Acceptance\nOffer. An offer expresses the offeror's intention to enter into a contract with\nan offeree to perform the terms of the agreement in exchange for the\nofferee's performance. In a real estate sale or lease contract, the offer must\nclearly contain all intended terms of the contract in writing and be\ncommunicated to the offeree.\nIf an offer contains an expiration date and the phrase \"time is of the\nessence,\" the offer expires at exactly the time specified. In the absence of a\nstated time period, the offeree has a \"reasonable\" time to accept an offer.\nAcceptance. An offer gives the offeree the power of accepting. For an\nacceptance to be valid, the offeree must manifestly and unequivocally accept\nall terms of the offer without change, and so indicate by signing the offer,\npreferably with a date of signing. The acceptance must then be communicated\nto the offeror. If the communication of acceptance is by mail, the offer is\nconsidered to be communicated as soon as it is placed in the mail.\nCounteroffer By changing any of the terms of an offer, the offeree creates a counteroffer,\nand the original offer is void. At this point, the offeree becomes the offeror,\nand the new offeree gains the right of acceptance. If accepted, the counteroffer\nbecomes a valid contract provided all other requirements are met.\nFor example, a seller changes the expiration date of a buyer's offer by one day,\nsigns the offer and returns it to the buyer. The single amendment extinguishes\nthe buyer's offer, and the buyer is no longer bound by any agreement. The\nseller's amended offer is a counteroffer which now gives the buyer the right of\n136 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

If the buyer accepts the counteroffer, the counteroffer becomes a\nbinding contract.\nRevocation of\nan offer An offer may be revoked, or withdrawn, at any time before the offeree has\ncommunicated acceptance. The revocation extinguishes the offer and the\nofferee's right to accept it.\nFor example, a buyer has offered to purchase a house for the listed price. Three\nhours later, a family death radically changes the buyer's plans. She\nimmediately calls the seller and revokes the offer, stating she is no longer\ninterested in the house. Since the seller had not communicated acceptance of\nthe offer to the buyer, the offer is legally cancelled.\nIf the offeree has paid consideration to the offeror to leave an offer open,\nand the offeror accepts, an option has been created which cancels the\nofferor's right to revoke the offer over the period of the option.\nTermination of\nan offer Any of the following actions or circumstances can terminate an offer:\n\uf034 acceptance: the offeree accepts the offer, converting it to a\ncontract\n\uf034 rejection: the offeree rejects the offer\n\uf034 revocation: the offeror withdraws the offer before acceptance\n\uf034 lapse of time: the offer expires\n\uf034 counteroffer: the offeree changes the offer\n\uf034 death or insanity of either party\nAssignment\nof a contract A real estate contract that is not a personal contract for services can be\nassigned to another party unless the terms of the agreement specifically\nprohibit assignment.\nListing agreements, for example, are not assignable, since they are personal\nservice agreements between agent and principal. Sales contracts, however, are\nassignable, because they involve the purchase of real property rather than a\npersonal service.\nContract\npreparation State laws define the extent to which real estate brokers and agents may legally\nprepare real estate contracts. Such laws, referred to as \"broker-lawyer accords,\"\nalso define what types of contracts brokers and agents may prepare. In some\nstates, brokers and agents may not draft contracts, but they may use standard\npromulgated forms and complete the blanks in the form.\nAs a rule, a broker or agent who completes real estate contracts is engaging\nin the unauthorized practice of law unless the broker is a party to the\nagreement, such as a in a listing agreement or sales contract. Brokers and\nagents may not complete leases, mortgages, contracts for deed, or promissory\nnotes to which they are not a party.\nAgents must be fully aware of what they are legally allowed to do and not do\nin preparing and interpreting contracts for clients. In addition to practicing law\nwithout a license, agents expose themselves to lawsuits from clients who relied\non a contract as being legally acceptable.\nChapter 10 Fundamentals of Contract Law 137",

    "text": "CLASSIFICATIONS OF CONTRACTS\nOral vs. written\nExpress vs. implied\nUnilateral vs. bilateral\nExecuted vs. executory\nOral vs. written A contract may be in writing or it may be an oral, or parol, contract. Certain\noral contracts are valid and enforceable, others are not enforceable, even if\nvalid. For example, most states require listing agreements, sales contracts,\nand leases exceeding one year to be in writing to be enforceable.\nExpress vs. implied An express contract is one in which all the terms and covenants of the\nagreement have been manifestly stated and agreed to by all parties, whether\nverbally or in writing.\nAn implied contract is an unstated or unintentional agreement that may be\ndeemed to exist when the actions of any of the parties suggest the existence of\nan agreement.\nA common example of an implied contract is an implied agency agreement. In\nimplied agency, an agent who does not have a contract with a buyer performs\nacts on the buyer's behalf, such as negotiating a price that is less than the\nlisting price. In so doing, the agent has possibly created an implied contract\nwith the buyer, albeit unintended. If the buyer compensates the agent for the\nnegotiating efforts, the existence of an implied agency agreement becomes\neven less disputable.\nBilateral vs.\nunilateral A bilateral contract is one in which both parties promise to perform their\nrespective parts of an agreement in exchange for performance by the other\nparty.\nAn example of a bilateral contract is an exclusive listing: the broker\npromises to exercise due diligence in the efforts to sell a property, and the\nseller promises to compensate the broker when and if the property sells.\nIn a unilateral contract, only one party promises to do something, provided the\nother party does something. The latter party is not obligated to perform any act,\nbut the promising party must fulfill the promise if the other party chooses to\nperform.\nAn option is an example of a unilateral contract: in an option-to-buy, the party\noffering the option (optionor) promises to sell a property if the optionee\ndecides to exercise the option. While the potential buyer does not have to buy,\nthe owner must sell if the option is exercised.\nExecuted vs.\nexecutory An executed contract is one that has been fully performed and fulfilled:\nneither party bears any further obligation. A completed and expired lease\ncontract is an executed contract: the landlord may re-possess the premises\nand the tenant has no further obligation to pay rent.\n138 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "An executory contract is one in which performance is yet to be completed. A\nsales contract prior to closing is executory: while the parties have agreed to buy\nand sell, the buyer has yet to pay the seller and the seller has yet to deed the\nproperty to the buyer.\nCONTRACT TERMINATION\nForms of contract termination\nBreach of contract\nForms of contract\ntermination Termination of a contract, also called cancellation and discharge, may occur for\nany of the following causes.\nPerformance. A contract terminates when fully performed by the parties. It\nmay also terminate for:\n\uf034 partial performance, if the parties agree\n\uf034 sufficient performance, if a court determines a party has\nsufficiently performed the contract, even though not to the\nfull extent of every provision\nInfeasibility. An otherwise valid contract can be canceled if it is not possible\nto perform. Certain personal services contracts, for example, depend on the\nunique capabilities of one person which cannot be substituted by someone\nelse. If such a person dies or is sufficiently disabled, the contract is\ncancelable.\nMutual agreement. Parties to a contract can agree to terminate, or renounce,\nthe contract. If the parties wish to create a new contract to replace the\ncancelled contract, they must comply with the validity requirements for the\nnew contract. Such substitution is called novation.\nCooling-period rescission. Rescission is the act of nullifying a contract. In\nmany states, parties to certain contracts are allowed a statutory amount of time\nafter entering into a contract, or \"cooling period\", to rescind the contract\nwithout cause. No reason need be stated for the cancellation, and the\ncancelling party incurs no liability for performance.\nFor example, consider the unsuspecting buyer of a lot in a new resort\ndevelopment. Such buyers are often the targets of hard-sell tactics which lead\nto a completed sales contract and a deposit. The statutory cooling period\ngives the buyer an opportunity to reconsider the investment in the absence of\nthe persistent salesperson.\nRevocation. Revocation is cancellation of the contract by one party without\nthe consent of the other. For example, a seller may revoke a listing to take the\nproperty off the market. While all parties have the power to revoke, they may\nnot have a defensible right. In the absence of justifiable grounds, a revocation\nmay not relieve the revoking party of contract obligations.\nChapter 10 Fundamentals of Contract Law 139",

    "text": "For example, a seller who revokes a listing without grounds may be required to\npay a commission if the broker found a buyer, or reimburse the broker's\nmarketing expenses if no buyer was found.\nAbandonment. Abandonment occurs when parties fail to perform\ncontract obligations. This situation may allow the parties to cancel the\ncontract.\nLapse of time. If a contract contains an expiration provision and date, the\ncontract automatically expires on the deadline.\nInvalidity of contract. If a contract is void, it terminates without the need\nfor disaffirmation. A voidable contract can be cancelled by operation of\nlaw or by rescission.\nBreach of contract A breach of contract is a failure to perform according to the terms of the\nagreement. Also called default, a breach of contract gives the damaged party\nthe right to take legal action.\nThe damaged party may elect the following legal remedies:\n\uf034 rescission\n\uf034 forfeiture\n\uf034 suit for damages\n\uf034 suit for specific performance\nRescission. A damaged party may rescind the contract. This cancels the\ncontract and returns the parties to their pre-contract condition, including the\nrefunding of any monies already transferred.\nForfeiture. A forfeiture requires the breaching party to give up something,\naccording to the terms of the contract. For example, a buyer who defaults on a\nsales contract may have to forfeit the earnest money deposit.\nSuit for damages. A damaged party may sue for money damages in civil court.\nThe suit must be initiated within the time period allowed by the statute of\nlimitations. When a contract states the total amount due to a damaged party in\nthe event of a breach, the compensation is known as liquidated damages. If the\ncontract does not specify the amount, the damaged party may sue in court for\nunliquidated damages.\nSuit for specific performance. A suit for specific performance is an attempt to\nforce the defaulting party to comply with the terms of the contract. Specific\nperformance suits occur when it is difficult to identify damages because of the\nunique circumstances of the real property in question. The most common\ninstance is a defaulted sale or lease contract where the buyer or seller wants the\ncourt to compel the defaulting party to go through with the transaction, even\nwhen the defaulter would prefer to pay a damage award.\n140 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",
