The core activity of real estate brokerage is the business\nof procuring a buyer, seller, tenant, or property on behalf of a client for the\npurpose of completing a transaction. If successful, the broker receives a\ncommission according to the provisions of a listing agreement. A broker's\ncompensation for effecting a transaction is usually a negotiated percentage of the\npurchase price.\nBroker cooperation. In most cases, transactions require the assistance of a\ncooperating broker from another brokerage company acting as a subagent. Most\nlisting agreements provide for brokerage cooperation in the multiple listing\nclause. A transaction involving a cooperating subagent is called co-brokerage. In\na co-brokered transaction, the listing broker splits the commission with the \"co-\nbroker,\" typically on a 50-50 basis. A broker may cooperate with other brokers\non either side of a transaction, either assisting a listing agent to locate a buyer or\ntenant, or assisting a buyer or tenant representative in locating a seller or\nlandlord.\nIn the most common form of broker cooperation, an outside broker locates a\nbuyer for the listing broker's seller. In such cases, the listing broker shares the\ncommission with the cooperating \"selling\" broker on a pre-determined basis.\nMultiple listing service (MLS). The second prevalent form of broker\ncooperation is the multiple listing service, or MLS. A multiple listing service is\nan organization of brokers who have agreed to cooperate with member brokers in\nmarketing listings. Members of the service also agree to enter all exclusive\nlistings into the listing distribution network so that every member is promptly\ninformed of new listings as they come on the market.\nThe listing agreement used by members of a multiple listing service discloses\nrelevant procedures and policies so that all principal parties to the agreement are\naware of the pooling of the listing.

The listing agreement sets forth specific duties.\nCritical brokerage skills. To generate business, as well as achieve the\ntransactional objectives of clients, a broker must be proficient in four skill areas:\n\uf034 obtaining a client listing\n\uf034 marketing a listing\n\uf034 facilitating the closing of a transaction\n\uf034 managing market information\nA client hires a broker by executing a listing agreement. Once hired, the broker or\nagent implements a marketing plan to procure the other principal party for the\ntransaction. The broker then plays an important role in pre-closing activities to\nensure successful closing of the transaction.\nTo serve clients and locate customers, a broker must become expert in local real\nestate market conditions. A fundamental part of maintaining market expertise is\norganizing and managing an information system.\nTypes of transactions and properties brokered. Brokers and salespeople are\nlicensed to broker all types of real property for clients in any form of transaction.\nIn practice, it is common for brokers and agents to specialize in a type of\nproperty, a type of transaction, or a geographical area.\nBrokerage vs. trading. The distinction between brokerage and trading for one's\nown account is important for determining whether one must be licensed to\nperform the real estate activity in question. To be considered brokerage, an\nagent's activity must generally be conducted on behalf of a person or business\nentity other than the agent. Buying, selling, and leasing real estate for one's own\naccount or for one's company are generally not considered brokerage.\nBrokerage vs. advisory services. Technically, brokerage is distinct from the\npractice of rendering real estate advisory services. A licensed broker acting as a\nconsultant for a fee usually is not working to effect a particular transaction. Since\nthe objective is not purely transaction-oriented, the activity is not really\nbrokerage. Examples of advisory services include:\n\uf034 providing an estimate of value\n\uf034 performing market analysis\n\uf034 managing property\nEven though fee consulting is not brokerage in the strict sense, real estate\nconsultants who offer advisory services to the public must have a real estate\nlicense in most states.\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 175",

Real estate license laws. All fifty states (and Canada) impose legal licensing\nrequirements on any person or business entity desiring to broker real estate. To\nobtain a broker's license, an applicant must complete required education, meet\nexperience requirements as a salesperson, and pass a state examination. There\nmay be additional requirements concerning age, criminal record, and professional\nbackground. Practicing real estate brokerage without a valid license is illegal.\nAnyone who plans to obtain a real estate license should become familiar with the\nreal estate license law of the relevant state.\nRange of business entities. Some business entities may legally broker real\nestate, and others may not. The principal types of business organization and the\nlegal restrictions on their ability to broker real estate are described below. Note\nthat all the business entities may own, buy, and sell their own real estate in\nvarying degrees without violating license laws.\nSole proprietorship. A sole proprietorship is a business owned by a single\nindividual. When the proprietor dies, the business terminates. Sole\nproprietorships must follow state licensing and registration laws to conduct\nbusiness, such as fictitious name laws. Other distinguishing characteristics of\nsole proprietorships are:\n\uf034 liability: sole proprietors are personally liable for their own debts\nand actions and those of employees while performing business\nduties; proprietors may be sued personally\n176 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

A general partnership is a for-profit business consisting of\ntwo or more co-owners who have agreed to share business profits. Unlike a\ncorporation, the general partnership is not a distinct, legal entity, although a\ncorporation may be a partner in a general partnership. Additional distinguishing\nfeatures are:\n\uf034 formation: the partnership is formed by a written or oral\npartnership agreement with or without a financial investment by\neither partner\n\uf034 dissolution: the partnership may be terminated through mutual\nagreement, withdrawal or death of a partner, or by legal action\n\uf034 liability: all partners bear full liability for debts and obligations\njointly and severally\n\uf034 taxation: partners are taxed once on their respective partnership\nprofits; partnerships do not have double-taxation\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 177",

    "text": "Transaction-specialized brokerages. Brokerages often organize around a\nparticular type of transaction. Thus, there are companies that specialize in\napartment rentals, office rentals, exchanges, business brokerage, and, most\ncommonly, residential sales.\nBuyer- and seller-oriented brokerages. Companies sometimes specialize even\nfurther by choosing to represent only one side in a transaction. Thus a brokerage\nmay represent only commercial tenants, or only residential buyers, or some other\nlimited type of client.\nTrade\norganizations Numerous trade organizations serve the real estate brokerage industry and all of\nits areas of specialization. The largest is the National Association of Realtors\u00ae\n(NAR). NAR is comprised of a national headquarters, a state association in each\nstate, and within each state, local Realtor\u00ae boards.\nOne should note that the term Realtor\u00ae is a protected trade name of NAR. Only\nmembers of the organization may use the term to refer to themselves. More\nspecifically, there are two identities within NAR: Realtor, and Realtor-Associate.\nBy definition, a Realtor\u00ae is a member broker and a Realtor-Associate\u00ae is a\nmember sales agent. (In some states, Realtor applies to both broker and sales\nagent.)

A licensed salesperson may work only for the employing broker and\nmay not work for or receive direct compensation from any other broker.\nAgent's scope of authority. State real estate license laws provide for two distinct\nlicenses to conduct real estate brokerage: the broker license and the salesperson or\nsales agent license.\nA licensed real estate broker is duly authorized to represent clients directly in\nbrokering real estate. A sales agent, on the other hand, is only authorized to\nrepresent a broker and carry out such duties as the broker may legitimately\ndelegate. In other words, a sales agent does not directly represent the client in a\ntransaction but is rather the agent of the broker and subagent of the client. A sales\nagent is therefore a fiduciary of the employing broker.\nAs agent of a broker, a salesperson may offer properties for sale or lease, procure\nbuyers, negotiate transaction terms, and otherwise conduct the business of\nbrokerage. The agent, however, must act entirely on the broker's behalf.\n180 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

A sales agent earns compensation for procuring listings and\nfor procuring buyers or tenants, whenever a transaction results. In the jargon of\nbrokerage, these are the two \"sides\" to a commission: the listing side and the\nselling side. An agent who procures a listing receives a share of the broker's\nlisting side commission, according to the agent's commission schedule. An agent\nwho sells a listing, i.e., finds the customer, receives a share of the broker's selling\nside of the commission, according to the commission schedule.

    "text": "The goal of prospecting is to reach a potential seller or landlord, make that person\naware of the agent's and brokerage's services, and obtain permission to discuss\nthe benefits of listing, often in the form of a formal selling presentation.\nPricing. It is almost always necessary for an agent seeking a listing to suggest a\nlisting price or price range for the property. It is important to make a careful\nestimate, because underpricing a property is not in the best interests of the seller,\nand overpricing it often prevents a transaction altogether.\nThe \"Appraisal\" chapter describes methods of estimating value. In brief, an agent\nusually relies on an analysis of comparable properties which have recently sold in\nthe same neighborhood. By making adjustments for the differences between the\nsubject property and the comparables, the agent arrives at a general price range.\nAgents must be careful to caution sellers that they are not appraisers, and that the\nsuggested price range is not an expert opinion of market value. If a more precise\nestimate of market value is desired, the seller should hire a licensed appraiser.\nListing presentation and negotiation of agreement. A listing presentation is an\nagent's opportunity to meet with a seller and present the merits of the agent's\nmarketing plan, personal expertise, and company strengths. At the same time, an\nagent can explain the many phases and details of a real estate transaction and\npoint out how the provisions of the listing agreement and the agent-principal\nrelationship work to ensure a smooth transaction.\nUltimately, the agent's aim in a presentation meeting is to have the principal\nexecute a listing agreement. The agent must then submit the listing to the broker\nfor approval and signing. This result will set in motion the process of marketing\nthe property. In practice, it may take an agent many meetings with a prospect\nbefore the prospect signs an agreement.\nMarketing listings The process of marketing a listed property occurs in three broad steps, leading to\nthe desired end of a completed sale contract. At each of these steps, there are\ncritical skills an agent must master.\nExhibit 13.5 Marketing Steps\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 185",

An ideal marketing plan is a\ncohesive combination of promotional and selling activities directed at potential\ncustomers. The best combination is one that aims to have maximum impact on\nthe marketplace in relation to the time and money expended.\nSelling the prospect. When marketing activities produce prospects, the agent's\nmarketing role becomes more interpersonal. An agent must now:\n\uf034 qualify prospects' plans, preferences, and financial capabilities\n\uf034 show properties that meet the customer's needs\n\uf034 elicit the buyer's reactions to properties\n\uf034 report material results to the seller or listing agent\nAt the earliest appropriate time, an agent must make certain disclosures to a\nprospective customer. Depending on state laws, an agent may have to disclose the\nrelevant agency relationship, the property's physical condition, and the possible\npresence of hazardous materials.\nObtaining offers. If a buyer is interested in purchasing a property, an agent\nobtains the buyer's offer of transaction terms, including price, down payment,\ndesired closing date, and financing requirements.\nAn agent must be extremely careful at this point to abide by fiduciary obligations\nto the client, whoever that party may be. Discussions of price are particularly\ndelicate: whether the client is buyer or seller, the agent's duty is to uphold the\nclient's best interests. Thus it is not acceptable to suggest to a customer what\nprice the client will or will not accept. With pricing and other issues, it is always\na good practice to understand what role the client wants the agent to assume in\nthe offering phase of the transaction; in other words, exactly how far the agent\nmay go in developing terms on the client's behalf.\nWhen a buyer or tenant makes an offer, the agent must present it to the seller or\nlandlord at the earliest possible moment. If the terms of the offer are\nunacceptable, the agent may assist the seller in developing a counteroffer, which\nthe agent would subsequently submit to the customer or customer's agent. The\noffering and counteroffering process continues until a meeting of the minds\nresults in a sale contract.\nPre-closing activities Between the execution of the sale contract and the closing of the transaction, the\nproperty is \"under contract\" or \"contract pending.\" During this period, buyer and\nseller have certain things to do to achieve a successful closing. The buyer often\nneeds to arrange financing and dispose of other property; the seller may need to\nclear up title encumbrances and make certain property repairs. The sale contract\nshould specify all such required tasks.\nThe time period between contracting and closing is referred to as the\ncontingency period, or pre-closing period.\nAgent's responsibilities. As dictated by custom and the circumstances of a\ntransaction, an agent has a range of duties and responsibilities during the pre-\nclosing period.\n186 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Such non-trust funds must be identified as such in the trust\naccount.\nCommingling. Commingling is the act of mixing the broker's personal or\nbusiness funds with escrow funds. To avoid committing a violation, a broker\nmust not deposit any money belonging to others in the broker's business or\npersonal account. Also, a broker must not deposit operating funds into any trust\naccount. The definition of commingling includes the failure to deposit earnest\nmoney into escrow in a timely manner. In most states, commingling funds\nconstitutes grounds for license suspension or revocation and is a serious violation\nof the law.\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 187",

    "text": "Conversion. Conversion is the act of misappropriating escrow funds for the\nbroker's business or personal use. More serious than mere commingling,\nconversion is effectively an act of theft: using monies which do not belong to the\nbroker. Conversion carries serious consequences, including license revocation.\nDeposit deadlines. A real estate broker must deposit trust funds received within\na required deadline after receiving notice that an offer to purchase is accepted by\nall parties. The deadline varies from state-to-state, so licensees must be familiar\nwith local regulations to remain in compliance with escrow laws.\nHolding funds. Brokers must retain the trust monies in the trust account until\nthe transaction involved is consummated or terminated, at which time the broker\nmust account for the full amount received and disbursed.\nIf a purchase agreement signed by a seller and purchaser provides for someone\nother than a real estate broker to hold a deposit, a licensee in possession of that\ndeposit must deliver the deposit to that person within the required number of\nbanking days after the licensee receives notice that an offer to purchase is\naccepted by all parties.\nReturn of earnest money deposit. Generally, escrow funds are disbursed to the\nrespective parties at closing, or according to escrow instructions. However, if\nany trust fund disbursement is disputed, the broker must follow very specific\nprocedures for handling the dispute. Depending on the jurisdiction, these can\nrange from arbitration to court-ordered resolutions. In any case, the broker must\nrely on state regulations and legal solutions instituted by the courts.\nSalesperson receiving trust funds. A real estate salesperson must deliver to the\nreal estate broker, on receipt, a deposit or other money paid in connection with a\ntransaction in which the real estate salesperson is engaged on behalf of the real\nestate broker.\nCommunications\nand technology Multiple listing services and websites. The posting and sharing of property\nlistings and data among broker websites, firm websites, and multiple listing\nservices (MLS) is one of the most effective marketing tools available to today\u2019s\nlicensees. Broker cooperation assures sellers of maximum exposure for their\nproperties, just as it assures buyers of seeing the widest possible range of listed\nproperties.\nTo ensure fair use of MLS facilities, the National Association of REALTORS\u00ae\nhas developed an Internet Data Exchange (IDX) policy that enables MLS\nmembers to display and use MLS data while respecting the rights of property\nowners and brokers to market their properties however they want.\nBasically, persons who want to make use of MLS data have to share their own\ndata as well. They can opt out of the sharing policy so that competitors cannot\npost their properties on competing websites, but then they cannot post\ncompetitors\u2019 properties on their own sites.\nThere are a number of websites that provide consumers with the capability to\nsearch through listings all over the country and even the world. Of course, it is\n188 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Frequent and virtually instantaneous contact between real\nestate practitioners and consumers is possible via email and texting. As both these\nforms of communication fall under the category of advertising, practitioners need\nto carefully observe their state\u2019s advertising regulations. In brief, be truthful,\ndirect, and concise. Provide the information required by law, and do not violate\nprohibitions against unsolicited emails and messages.\nSocial media. Social media websites allow rapid exchange of information,\ndocuments, photos, messages and data with a select group of contacts. They also\nrepresent another form of advertising and so are subject to real estate commission\nadvertising regulations in most states.\nSmartphones. Smartphones facilitate the use, not only of email, texting, and\nsocial media, but also of immediate internet access, document review, photo and\ndocument sharing, data storage, and video conferencing. They offer, in fact, an\nalmost complete mobile office.\nManaging\ninformation The ability to satisfy the needs of clients and customers is largely dependent on a\nbroker's ability to obtain, organize, and manage information. Information is a\ncornerstone of the broker's perceived value in the marketplace and a major reason\nwhy buyers and sellers seek a broker out. Systematic collection and updating of\nrelevant information is therefore a business priority.\nProperty data. Most brokerages maintain two categories of property data:\navailable properties, and all properties in the market area. In residential\nbrokerage, available property basically consists of the listings in the MLS and\nfor-sale-by-owner properties. Records for all properties in an area are accessible\nin tax records. Commercial brokerages usually keep track of available and\noccupied commercial properties in a proprietary database.\nBuyer data. Buyer information is usually compiled and maintained, often\ninformally, by each agent in a brokerage. An agency's base of prospects who are\nlooking for property at any given time is valuable for marketing new listings.\nTenant data. In residential and commercial leasing companies, information is\ncompiled and maintained on all tenants in an area, by property type used. Such\nfiles contain a tenant's lease expiration, property size, and rent.\nClient data. It is important to keep track of both current and former clients.\nFormer clients are likely prospects to become clients again or customers. They\nare also a source of referrals. Current clients, of course, should be the broker's\nprimary concern.\nMarket data. Today's clients and customers expect a broker to know the market\nintimately. It is often the broker or agent with the best market knowledge who\ndominates business in the market. Knowing a market includes keeping up to date\non:\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 189",

    "text": "Anti-trust laws Brokerage companies, like other businesses, are subject to anti-trust laws\ndesigned to prevent monopolies and unfair trade practices.\nSherman Antitrust Act. Enacted in 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits\nrestraint of interstate and foreign trade by conspiracy, monopolistic practice, and\ncertain forms of business combinations, or mergers. The Sherman Act empowers\nthe federal government to proceed against antitrust violators.\nClayton Antitrust Act. The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 reinforces and\nbroadens the provisions of the Sherman Act. Among its prohibitions are certain\nexclusive contracts, predatory price cutting to eliminate competitors, and inter-\nrelated boards of directors and stock holdings between same-industry\ncorporations. The Clayton Act also legalizes certain labor strikes, picketing, and\nboycotts.\nAnti-competitive behavior. The effect of antitrust legislation is to prohibit trade\npractice and trade restraints that unfairly disadvantage open competition.\nBusiness practices and behaviors which violate antitrust laws include collusion,\nprice fixing, market allocation, bid rigging, restricting market entry, exclusive\ndealing, group boycotts, and predatory pricing.\nCollusion. Collusion is the illegal practice of two or more businesses joining forces\nor making joint decisions which have the effect of putting another business at a\ncompetitive disadvantage. Businesses may not collude to fix prices, allocate\nmarkets, create monopolies, or otherwise interfere with free market operations.\nPrice fixing. Price fixing is the practice of two or more brokers agreeing to\ncharge certain commission rates or fees for their services, regardless of market\nconditions or competitors. In essence, such pricing avoids and disturbs the\ndynamics of a free, open market.\nFor instance, the two largest brokerages in a market jointly decide to cut\ncommission rates by 50% in order to draw clients away from competitors. The\ncut-rate pricing could destroy smaller agencies that lack the staying power of the\nlarge companies.\nMarket allocation. Market allocation is the practice of colluding to restrict\ncompetitive activity in portions of a market in exchange for a reciprocal\nrestriction from a competitor: \"we won't compete against you here if you won't\ncompete against us there.\"\nFor example, Broker A agrees to trade only in single family re-sales, provided\nthat Broker B agrees to focus exclusively on apartment rentals and condominium\nsales. The net effect is an illegally restricted market where collusion and\nmonopoly supplant market forces.\nGroup boycott. Group boycotting is the illegal activity of a number of\ncompetitors in a given market \"ganging up\" on a competitor in that market to\nlimit the boycotted party's access to customers and patrons of the competitor's\nbusiness. For instance, a group of brokers might collectively refuse to show a\nboycotted broker's listings to potential buyers. Over time, the boycotted\ncompany is essentially \"starved\" out of the market.\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 191",

Loss of one's license is also at stake. Brokers are\nwell-advised to understand and recognize these laws.\nBUSINESS BROKERAGE\nBusiness brokerage vs. real property\nbrokerage\nTransaction knowledge\nAccounting\nDetermining a price\nBusiness brokerage regulation\nBusiness brokerage is effecting a sale or exchange of an existing business. In\nmost cases, the sale of a business entails the simultaneous transfer of an estate in\nland, whether a leasehold or a fee. Thus to sell businesses, a broker must\ngenerally hold a real estate license.\nIn some states, business brokerage is classified into opportunity brokerage and\nenterprise brokerage in accordance with the size of the business being sold.\nOpportunity brokerage concerns a small business, usually a proprietorship or\npartnership, where the transaction consists of a sale of assets and an assignment\nof a lease. Enterprise brokerage concerns a larger company, usually a\ncorporation, where the transaction involves the sale of stock and multiple real\nestate parcels leased or owned by the seller.\nThe process of business brokerage is similar to real estate brokerage: a broker\nsecures a listing, procures a purchaser, and facilitates the closing. Once a ready,\nwilling, and able buyer is found, the broker earns a commission.\nBusiness brokerage\nvs real property\nbrokerage The critical difference between selling a business and selling real estate is that\nselling a business includes the transfer of business income, personal property\nassets, and, possibly, liabilities, in addition to real property. To be competent in\nthis brokerage specialty, a business broker must have specialized skills\nconcerning transactions, accounting, and pricing. A business broker must also\nrely on a professional team to complete the transaction. Members of this team\nwould include the client's legal counsel, accountant, and, preferably, a\nprofessional appraiser.\nTransaction\nknowledge Types of sale. There are generally two types of business sale transaction for a\nbusiness broker to be aware of: the asset sale and the stock sale. In an asset sale,\nthe purchaser takes possession of some or all of the assets of the business, as well\nas the real estate, in exchange for the sale price. The purchase usually does not\n192 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "include acquiring the existing business entity or its liabilities. An asset sale is\npreferred by buyers who want to buy only portions of a business, or to avoid\nliabilities inherent in a stock purchase.\nIn a stock sale, a purchaser acquires complete ownership of a business, including\nthe legal corporate entity, all assets, all financial liabilities, and any current or\nfuture legal liabilities arising from incidents that have occurred prior to the sale.\nA purchaser may prefer a stock sale to avoid creating a new business entity or to\nbenefit from a possible tax advantage. In addition, a stock sale keeps a business\nidentity intact, which can be very valuable.\nTransaction documents. The most common transaction documents in business\nbrokerage are a sale contract, an assignment or real estate sale contract, a no-\ncompete agreement, and a consulting agreement.\nA sale contract sets forth all terms and conditions of the agreement, including\nexactly what is being sold. An assignment or real estate sale agreement is an\nagreement for transferring any and all real property involved in the transaction. A\nno-compete agreement is a seller's covenant, for compensation, not to compete\nwith the buyer under prescribed conditions and time periods. A consulting\nagreement is an employment agreement that hires the seller to assist the buyer in\ntaking over business operations.\nFor the most part, transaction documents in business brokerage are not fully\nstandardized. For that reason, a business broker must exercise caution in dealing\nwith document language so as to avoid the unauthorized practice of law.\nAccounting A broker or agent who wants to undertake business brokerage needs basic\nproficiency in accounting. In particular, one must know how to read and\ninterpret:\n\uf034 income, expenses, and profit on an income statement\n\uf034 assets, liabilities, and net worth on a balance sheet\nIncome, expenses, and profit. A business's profit is the revenue remaining from\ngross income after all expenses have been paid. A business broker must evaluate\nan owner's income and expenses in order to determine what the business may be\nworth to a buyer. This often involves interpreting which income and expense\nitems will change after the business is sold. For example, a seller owns a grocery\nstore and uses family members to perform clerical work without pay. If a buyer is\na bachelor without children, much of the clerical work will have to be hired out.\nThe additional payroll suddenly changes the store's profitability significantly.\nNeglecting to consider how income and expenses might change is likely to lead\nto serious problems in working with buyers.\nBusiness assets. The assets of a business include tangible assets and intangible\nassets. Tangible assets include:\n\uf034 cash and marketable securities\n\uf034 inventory\n\uf034 trade fixtures and equipment\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 193",

Business liabilities acquired in a corporate stock sale include\nshort-term debt, such as accounts payable, and long-term liabilities, such as\nmortgages and leases.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is a business brokerage term with two meanings. In one\nsense, goodwill is an intangible asset consisting of any factor that an owner\nvalues in the business, apart from any other specific asset. For example, goodwill\nmight include reputation, a long history of success in a market, name recognition,\na dominant market share, and an excellent business location. In the second sense,\nwhich is more familiar to accountants, goodwill is the difference in value between\nan owner's price and the value of all other business assets. For example, if an\nowner wants $400,000 for a business, and the totality of tangible and intangible\nassets is valued at $320,000, the goodwill is an $80,000 asset.\nDetermining a price The most difficult task for a business broker is often finding the proper price\nrange for a business. An owner of a smaller business has probably built the\nbusiness from scratch and tends to overvalue it. Moreover, such an owner may\nhave incomplete and disorganized accounting records, making the valuation of\nassets quite difficult. Finally, a business's true income may be different for one\nowner than it would be for another because of variations in management style\nand ability.\nIn any case, the value of the business is a function of the following:\n\uf034 past, present, and future net profits, and capitalized value of these\n\uf034 amount of risk and certainty associated with realizing future\nprofits\n\uf034 value of all assets as reflected in the books of account\n\uf034 impact of goodwill on the value of the business\n\uf034 prices paid for similar businesses\n\uf034 all other risks associated with the business\nBusiness brokerage\nregulation\nLicensing.

If a\nbusiness sells over half of its inventory to a buyer, the act declares that the sale is\na bulk sale, and, as such, is potentially an asset sale. Since a creditor could lose\nsecurity in such a sale, the seller must disclose the names of creditors to the buyer\nin a Bulk Sales Affidavit. The buyer must notify the creditors of the sale, who\nmay then take appropriate action to secure their loans.\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 195",
