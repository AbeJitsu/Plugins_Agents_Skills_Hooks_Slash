It is the\ndocument that is at the center of the transaction.\nThe conventional transfer of real estate ownership takes place in three stages.\nFirst, there is the negotiating period where buyers and sellers exchange offers in\nan effort to agree to all transfer terms that will appear in the sale contract.\nSecond, when both parties have accepted all terms, the offer becomes a binding\nsale contract and the transaction enters the pre-closing stage, during which each\nparty makes arrangements to complete the sale according to the sale contract's\nterms. Third is the closing of the transaction, when the seller deeds title to the\nbuyer, the buyer pays the purchase price, and all necessary documents are\ncompleted. At this stage, the sale contract has served its purpose and terminates.\nOther names for the sale contract are agreement of sale, contract for\npurchase, contract of purchase and sale, and earnest money contract.\nLegal characteristics Executory contract. A sale contract is executory: the signatories have yet to\nperform their respective obligations and promises. Upon closing, the sale\ncontract is fully performed and no longer exists as a binding agreement.\nSignatures. All owners of the property should sign the sale contract. If the\nsellers are married, both spouses should sign to ensure that both spouses release\nhomestead, dower, and curtesy rights to the buyer at closing. Failure to do so\ndoes not invalidate the contract but can lead to encumbered title and legal\ndisputes.\n198 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Enforceability criteria. To be enforceable, a sale contract must:\n\uf034 be validly created (mutual consent, consideration, legal purpose,\ncompetent parties, voluntary act)\n\uf034 be in writing\n\uf034 identify the principal parties\n\uf034 clearly identify the property, preferably by legal description\n\uf034 contain a purchase price\n\uf034 be signed by the principal parties\nWritten vs. oral form. A contract for the sale of real estate is enforceable only if\nit is in writing. A buyer or seller cannot sue to force the other to comply with an\noral contract for sale, even if the contract is valid.\nAssignment. Either party to a sale transaction can assign the sale contract to\nanother party, subject to the provisions and conditions contained in the agreement.\nWho may complete. A broker or agent may assist buyer and seller in completing\nan offer to purchase, provided the broker represents the client faithfully and does\nnot charge a separate fee for the assistance. It is advisable, and legally required in\nmost states, for a broker to use a standard contract form promulgated by state\nagencies or real estate boards, as such forms contain generally accepted language.\nThis relieves the broker of the dangers of creating new contract language, which\ncan be construed as a practice of law for which the broker is not licensed.\nContract creation Offer and acceptance. A contract of sale is created by full and unequivocal\nacceptance of an offer. Offer and acceptance may come from either buyer or\nseller. The offeree must accept the offer without making any changes\nwhatsoever. A change terminates the offer and creates a new offer, or\ncounteroffer. An offeror may revoke an offer for any reason prior to\ncommunication of acceptance by the offeree.\nEquitable title. A sale contract gives the buyer an interest in the property that is\ncalled equitable title, or ownership in equity. If the seller defaults and the buyer\ncan show good faith performance, the buyer can sue for specific performance, that\nis, to compel the seller to transfer legal title upon payment of the contract price.\nEarnest money\nescrow The buyer's earnest money deposit fulfills the consideration requirements for a\nvalid sale contract. In addition, it provides potential compensation for damages to\nthe seller if the buyer fails to perform. The amount of the deposit varies\naccording to local custom. It should be noted that the earnest money deposit is\nnot the only form of consideration that satisfies the requirement.\nThe sale contract provides the escrow instructions for handling and disbursing\nescrow funds. The earnest money is placed in a third party trust account or\nescrow. A licensed escrow agent employed by a title company, financial\ninstitution, or brokerage company usually manages the escrow. An individual\nbroker may also serve as the escrow agent.\nThe escrow holder acts as an impartial fiduciary for buyer and seller. If the buyer\nperforms under the sale contract, the deposit is applied to the purchase price.\nChapter 14 Overview of Conveyance Contracts 199",

    "text": "Strict rules govern the handling of earnest money deposits, particularly if a\nbroker is the escrow agent. For example, state laws direct the broker when to\ndeposit the funds, how to account for them, and how to keep them separate from\nthe broker's own funds.\nContract\ncontingencies A sale contract often contains contingencies. A contingency is a condition that\nmust be met before the contract is enforceable.\nThe most common contingency concerns financing. A buyer makes an offer\ncontingent upon securing financing for the property under certain terms on or\nbefore a certain date. If unable to secure the specified loan commitment by the\ndeadline, the buyer may cancel the contract and recover the deposit. An\nappropriate and timely loan commitment eliminates the contingency, and the\nbuyer must proceed with the purchase.\nIt is possible for both buyers and sellers to abuse contingencies in order to leave\nthemselves a convenient way to cancel without defaulting. To avoid problems,\nthe statement of a contingency should:\n\uf034 be explicit and clear\n\uf034 have an expiration date\n\uf034 expressly require diligence in the\neffort to fulfill the requirement\nA contingency that is too broad, vague, or excessive in duration may invalidate\nthe entire contract on the grounds of insufficiency of mutual agreement.\nDefault A sale contract is bilateral, since both parties promise to perform. As a result,\neither party may default by failing to perform. Note that a party's failure to meet a\ncontingency does not constitute default, but rather entitles the parties to cancel\nthe contract.\nBuyer default. If a buyer fails to perform under the terms of a sale contract, the\nbreach entitles the seller to legal recourse for damages. In most cases, the\ncontract itself stipulates the seller's remedies. The usual remedy is forfeiture of\nthe buyer's deposit as liquidated damages, provided the deposit is not grossly in\nexcess of the seller's actual damages. It is also customary to provide for the seller\nand broker to share the liquidated damages. The broker may not, however,\nreceive liquidated damages in excess of what the commission would have been\non the full listing price.\nIf the contract does not provide for liquidated damages, the seller may sue for\ndamages, cancellation, or specific performance.\nSeller default. If a seller defaults, the buyer may sue for specific performance,\ndamages, or cancellation.\n200 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "SALE CONTRACT PROVISIONS\nPrimary provisions\nSecondary provisions\nSale contracts can vary significantly in length and thoroughness. They also vary\naccording to the type of sale transaction they describe. Some of the varieties are:\n\uf034 Residential Contract of Sale\n\uf034 Commercial Contract of Sale\n\uf034 Foreclosure Contract of Sale\n\uf034 Contract of Sale for New Construction\n\uf034 Contract of Sale for Land\n\uf034 Exchange Agreement\nAs the most common sale transaction is a residential sale, a Residential Contract\nof Sale is the type with which a licensee should first become familiar.\nPrimary provisions A typical residential sale contract contains provisions of the following kind.\nParties, consideration, and property. One or more clauses will identify the\nparties, the property, and the basic consideration, which is the sale of the property\nin return for a purchase price.\nThere must be at least two parties to a sale contract: one cannot convey property\nto oneself. All parties must be identified, be of legal age, and have the capacity to\ncontract.\nThe property clause also identifies fixtures and personal property included in the\nsale. Unless expressly excluded, items commonly construed as fixtures are\nincluded in the sale. Similarly, items commonly considered personal property are\nnot included unless expressly included.\nLegal description. A legal description must be sufficient for a competent\nsurveyor to identify the property.\nPrice and terms. A clause states the final price and details how the purchase will\noccur. Of particular interest to the seller is the buyer's down payment, since the\ngreater the buyer's equity, the more likely the buyer will be able to secure\nfinancing. In addition, a large deposit represents a buyer's commitment to\ncomplete the sale.\nIf seller financing is involved, the sale contract sets forth the terms of the\narrangement: the amount and type of loan, the rate and term, and how the loan\nwill be paid off.\nIt is important for all parties to verify that the buyer's earnest money deposit,\ndown payment, loan proceeds, and other promised funds together equal the\npurchase price stated in the contract.\nChapter 14 Overview of Conveyance Contracts 201",

    "text": "Loan approval. A financing contingency clause states under what conditions the\nbuyer can cancel the contract without default and receive a refund of the earnest\nmoney. If the buyer cannot secure the stated financing by the deadline, the parties\nmay agree to extend the contingency by signing next to the changed dates.\nEarnest money deposit. A clause specifies how the buyer will pay the earnest\nmoney. It may allow the buyer to pay it in installments. Such an option enables a\nbuyer to hold on to the property briefly while obtaining the additional deposit\nfunds. For example, a buyer who wants to buy a house makes an initial deposit of\n$200, to be followed in twenty-four hours with an additional $2,000. The sale\ncontract includes the seller's acknowledgment of receipt of the deposit.\nEscrow. An escrow clause provides for the custody and disbursement of the\nearnest money deposit, and releases the escrow agent from certain liabilities in\nthe performance of escrow duties.\nClosing and possession dates. The contract states when title will transfer, as\nwell as when the buyer will take physical possession. Customarily, possession\noccurs on the date when the deed is recorded, unless the buyer has agreed to other\narrangements.\nThe closing clause generally describes what must take place at closing to avoid\ndefault. A seller must provide clear and marketable title. A buyer must produce\npurchase funds. Failure to complete any pre-closing requirements stated in the\nsale contract is default and grounds for the aggrieved party to seek recourse.\nConveyed interest; type of deed. One or more provisions will state what type of\ndeed the seller will use to convey the property, and what conditions the deed will\nbe subject to. Among common \"subject to\" conditions are easements, association\nmemberships, encumbrances, mortgages, liens, and special assessments.\nTypically, the seller conveys a fee simple interest by means of a general warranty\ndeed.\nTitle evidence. The seller covenants to produce the best possible evidence of\nproperty ownership. This is commonly in the form of title insurance.\nClosing costs. The contract identifies which closing costs each party will pay.\nCustomarily, the seller pays title and property-related costs, and the buyer pays\nfinancing-related costs. Annual costs such as taxes and insurance are prorated\nbetween the parties. Note that who pays any particular closing cost is an item for\nnegotiation.\nDamage and destruction. A clause stipulates the obligations of the parties in\ncase the property is damaged or destroyed. The parties may negotiate\nalternatives, including seller's obligation to repair, buyer's obligation to buy if\nrepairs are made, and the option for either party to cancel.\nDefault. A default clause identifies remedies for default. Generally, a buyer may\nsue for damages, specific performance, or cancellation. A seller may do likewise\nor claim the earnest money as liquidated damages.\n202 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The seller warrants that there will be no liens on the\nproperty that cannot be settled and extinguished at closing. In addition, the seller\nwarrants that all representations are true, and if found otherwise, the buyer may\ncancel the contract and reclaim the deposit.\nSecondary\nprovisions A sale contract may contain numerous additional clauses, depending on the\ncomplexity of the transaction. The following are some of the common provisions.\nInspections. The parties agree to inspections and remedial action based on\nfindings.\nOwner's association disclosure. The seller discloses existence of an association\nand the obligations it imposes.\nSurvey. The parties agree to a survey to satisfy financing requirements.\nEnvironmental hazards. The seller notifies the buyer that there may be hazards\nthat could affect the use and value of the property.\nCompliance with laws. The seller warrants that there are no undisclosed\nbuilding code or zoning violations.\nDue-on-sale clause. The parties state their understanding that loans that survive\nthe closing may be called due by the lender. Both parties agree to hold the other\nparty harmless for the consequences of an acceleration.\nSeller financing disclosure. The parties agree to comply with applicable state\nand local disclosure laws concerning seller financing.\nRental property; tenants rights. The buyer acknowledges the rights of tenants\nfollowing closing.\nFHA or VA financing condition. A contingency allows the buyer to cancel the\ncontract if the price exceeds FHA or VA estimates of the property's value.\nFlood plain; flood insurance. Seller discloses that the property is in a flood\nplain and that it must carry flood insurance if the buyer uses certain lenders for\nfinancing.\nCondominium assessments. Seller discloses assessments the owner must pay.\nForeign seller withholding. The seller acknowledges that the buyer must\nwithhold 15% of the purchase price at closing if the seller is a foreign person or\nentity and forward the withheld amount to the Internal Revenue Service.

    "text": "OPTION-TO-BUY CONTRACT\nContract requirements\nCommon provisions\nLegal aspects\nAn option-to-buy is an enforceable contract in which a potential seller, the\noptionor, grants a potential buyer, the optionee, the right to purchase a property\nbefore a stated time for a stated price and terms. In exchange for the right of\noption, the optionee pays the optionor valuable consideration.\nFor example, a buyer wants to purchase a property for $150,000, but needs to sell\na boat to raise the down payment. The boat will take two or three months to sell.\nTo accommodate the buyer, the seller offers the buyer an option to purchase the\nproperty at any time before midnight on the day that is ninety days from the date\nof signing the option. The buyer pays the seller $1,000 for the option. If buyer\nexercises the option, the seller will apply the $1,000 toward the earnest money\ndeposit and subsequent down payment. If the optionee lets the option expire, the\nseller keeps the $1,000. Both parties agree to the arrangement by completing a\nsale contract as an addendum to the option, then executing the option agreement\nitself.\nAn option-to-buy places the optionee under no obligation to purchase the\nproperty. However, the seller must perform under the terms of the contract if the\nbuyer exercises the option. An option is thus a unilateral agreement. Exercise of\nthe option creates a bilateral sale contract where both parties are bound to\nperform. An unused option terminates at the expiration date.\nAn optionee can use an option to prevent the sale of a property to another party\nwhile seeking to raise funds for the purchase. A renter with a lease option-to-buy\ncan accumulate down payment funds while paying rent to the landlord. For\nexample, an owner may lease a condominium to a tenant with an option to buy. If\nthe tenant takes the option, the landlord agrees to apply $100 of the monthly rent\npaid prior to the option date toward the purchase price. The tenant pays the\nlandlord the nominal sum of $200 for the option.\nOptions can also facilitate commercial property acquisition. The option period\ngives a buyer time to investigate zoning, space planning, building permits,\nenvironmental impacts, and other feasibility issues prior to the purchase without\nlosing the property to another party in the meantime.\nContract\nrequirements To be valid and enforceable, an option-to-buy must:\n\uf034 include actual, non-refundable consideration\nThe option must require the optionee to pay a specific\nconsideration that is separate from the purchase price. The\nconsideration cannot be refunded if the option is not exercised. If\nthe option is exercised, the consideration may be applied to the\nChapter 14 Overview of Conveyance Contracts 205",

If the option is a lease option, portions of the rent\nmay qualify as separate consideration.\n\uf034 include price and terms of the sale\nThe price and terms of the potential transaction must be clearly\nexpressed and cannot change over the option period. It is\ncustomary practice for the parties to complete and attach a sale\ncontract to the option as satisfaction of this requirement.\n\uf034 have an expiration date\nThe option must automatically expire at the end of a specific\nperiod.\n\uf034 be in writing\nSince a potential transfer of real estate is involved, most state\nstatutes of fraud require an option to be in writing.\n\uf034 include a legal description\n\uf034 meet general contract validity requirements\nThe basics include competent parties, the optionor's promise to\nperform, and the optionor's signature. Note that it is not necessary\nfor the optionee to sign the option.\nCommon provisions Beyond the required elements, it is common for an option to include provisions\ncovering:\n\uf034 how to deliver notice of election\nA clause clarifies how to make the option election, exactly when\nthe election must be completed, and any additional terms required\nsuch as an earnest money deposit.\n\uf034 forfeiture terms\nA clause provides that the optionor is entitled to the consideration if\nthe option term expires.\n\uf034 property and title condition warranties\nThe optionor warrants that the property will be maintained in a\ncertain condition, and that title will be marketable and insurable.\n206 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "\uf034 how option consideration will be credited\nA clause states how the optionor will apply the option\nconsideration toward the purchase price.\nLegal aspects Equitable interest. The optionee enjoys an equitable interest in the property\nbecause the option creates the right to obtain legal title. However, the option does\nnot in itself convey an interest in real property, only a right to do something\ngoverned by contract law.\nRecording. An option should be recorded, because the equitable interest it\ncreates can affect the marketability of title.\nAssignment. An option-to-buy is assignable unless the contract expressly\nprohibits assignment.\nCONTRACT FOR DEED\nInterests and rights\nLegal form\nDefault and recourse\nUsage guidelines\nA contract for deed is also called a land contract, an installment sale, a\nconditional sales contract, and an agreement for deed. It is a bilateral agreement\nbetween a seller, the vendor, and a buyer, the vendee, in which the vendor defers\nreceipt of some or all of the purchase price of a property over a specified period\nof time. During the period, the vendor retains legal title and the vendee acquires\nequitable title. The vendee takes possession of the property, makes stipulated\npayments of principal and interest to the vendor, and otherwise fulfills\nobligations as the contract requires. At the end of the period, the buyer pays the\nvendor the full purchase price and the vendor deeds legal title to the vendee.\nLike an option, a contract for deed offers a means for a marginally qualified\nbuyer to acquire property. In essence, the seller acts as lender, allowing the buyer\nto take possession and pay off the purchase price over time. A buyer may thus\navoid conventional down payment and income requirements imposed by\ninstitutional lenders. During the contract period, the buyer can work to raise the\nnecessary cash to complete the purchase or to qualify for a conventional\nmortgage.\nA contract for deed serves two primary purposes for a seller. First, it facilitates a\nsale that might otherwise be impossible. Second, it may give the seller certain\ntax benefits. Since the seller is not liable for capital gains tax until the purchase\nprice is received, the installment sale lowers the seller's tax liability in the year\nof the sale.\nChapter 14 Overview of Conveyance Contracts 207",

In particular, the vendor may not breach the obligation to convey legal title\nto the vendee upon receipt of the total purchase price. In addition, the vendor\nremains liable for underlying mortgage loans.\nVendee's rights and obligations. During the contract period, the buyer may\noccupy, use, enjoy, and profit from the property, subject to the provisions of the\nwritten agreement. The vendee must make periodic payments of principal and\ninterest and maintain the property. In addition, a vendee may have to pay\nproperty taxes and hazard insurance.\nLegal form Like other conveyance contracts, a contract for deed instrument identifies:\n\uf034 the principal parties\n\uf034 the property's legal description\n\uf034 consideration: specifically what the parties promise to do\n\uf034 the terms of the sale\n\uf034 obligations for property maintenance\n\uf034 default and remedies\n\uf034 signatures and acknowledgment\nThe contract specifies the vendee's payments, payment deadlines, when the\nbalance of the purchase price is due, and how the property may be used.\nDefault and recourse Seller default. If the seller defaults, such as by failing to deliver the deed, the\nbuyer may sue for specific performance, or for cancellation of the agreement and\ndamages.\nBuyer default. States differ in the remedies they prescribe for the seller in case\nof buyer default. Some states consider the default a breach of contract that may\nbe remedied by cancellation, retention of monies received, and eviction. Others\nprovide foreclosure proceedings as a remedy.\nUsage guidelines Many areas have no standardized contract for deed or any form sanctioned by\nassociations and agencies. Therefore, this kind of conveyance presents certain\npitfalls for buyer and seller.\nIn some states, a breach of the contract for deed is remedied under local contract\nlaw rather than foreclosure law. The buyer may not have the protections of a\nredemption period or other buyer-protection laws which accompany formal\nforeclosure proceedings. The vendor might sue the vendee for breach of contract\nfor the slightest infraction of the contract terms.\nA second danger for the vendee is that the vendor has the power and the right to\nencumber the property in ways that may not be desirable for the buyer.
