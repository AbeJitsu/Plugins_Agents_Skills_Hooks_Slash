In Alabama, the laws that set forth the Real Estate Consumer's Agency and\nDisclosure Act are found in Articles 4 and 5, Section 34-27 and in Chapter 790-\nX-3 of the Alabama Real Estate License Law. The following definitions apply to\nthose laws and to agency relationships and disclosures.\nAgency agreement is a written brokerage agreement between a real estate\ncompany and a consumer that creates a fiduciary relationship between the\ncompany\u2019s qualifying broker and the consumer wherein the real estate company\nis hired to represent the consumer, who becomes a client and represents the\nclient's interest in a real estate transaction.\nBrokerage agreement is a specific written agreement between a real estate\ncompany and a consumer that establishes a brokerage relationship and contains\nthe terms and conditions of the services to be provided, including any\ncompensation to be paid to or through the company. The term encompasses both\nagency transaction facilitator agreements.\nBrokerage service is any service provided by a broker or licensee to another\nperson which includes activities for which a real estate license is required. Rental\nand property management are not included.\nBuyer\u2019s agreement is an agreement between a real estate company and a person\nwho is purchasing real estate in which the company agrees to assist that person\nwith the purchase in exchange for a fee as either a fiduciary or a non-fiduciary.\nConsumer is a person who obtains information, advice, or services from a real\nestate licensee regarding real estate and real estate transactions.\nChapter 28: Alabama Agency 481",

A client can be either a buyer or a seller.\nDual agency is an agency relationship in which a licensee represents both the\nseller and the buyer in the same transaction with the informed written consent of\nall parties, who have signed the consent agreement.\nFiduciary duties are those owed to a client when an agency agreement has been\nsigned. Fiduciary duties are those performed under obligation and trust and\ninclude loyalty and reasonable care.\nInformed consent is a consumer's agreement to allow something to happen based\non full disclosure of the facts needed to choose appropriate brokerage services.\nListing agreement is an agreement between a real estate company and a property\nowner who is selling real estate in which the company agrees to assist that party\nwith the sale in exchange for a fee as either a fiduciary or a non-fiduciary and\nalso applies to the seller\u2019s future decision to sell the property.\nMaterial fact is a fact that is of significance to a reasonable party which affects\nthe party's decision to enter into a real estate contract.\nSingle agent is a licensee who is engaged by and represents only one party in a\nreal estate transaction through a signed agency agreement. A single agent can be\na seller's agent or a buyer's agent. A single agent may be only a buyer\u2019s agent or a\nseller\u2019s agent in any single transaction.\nTransaction facilitator is a licensee who assists one or more parties in a\ntransaction without being an agent, fiduciary, or advocate for that party's interest\nin the transaction. Without a signed agreement in place, a transaction facilitator\nrelationship remains in effect.\nProtection to the\nconsumer Home buyers and sellers are often confused about the real estate salesperson or\nbroker's role in residential real estate transactions. They are also often unclear\nabout whom the salesperson or broker actually represents and what defines the\nboundaries of the agent-buyer-seller relationship.\nTo help clear up the confusion and protect consumers, the Alabama Legislature\nenacted the Real Estate Consumer Agency and Disclosure Act (RECAD) to set\nforth the roles and duties of real estate brokers.\nAlabama law requires that consumers be informed about the types of services that\nreal estate licensees may perform. Therefore, RECAD required the AREC to\nwrite a Real Estate Brokerage Services Disclosure form. All licensees must use\nthe form as a means of disclosure to consumers. While consumers are not\nrequired to sign the form, licensees should encourage them to do so as\nacknowledgement of having received the form.

The consumer may also choose which brokerage arrangement and services\nbest suits his or her needs. The consumer may choose any of the brokerage\narrangements available (to be discussed in detail later in this chapter) or may\nchoose not to enter into a brokerage or agency relationship at all. If the consumer\nchooses not to sign a brokerage arrangement, there is no agency relationship.\nA signed agency agreement must be in place before the licensee can perform\ncertain acts, such as making any offers for buyers or listing a property for sellers.\nA licensee may show properties to potential clients or host an open house without\nhaving an agency agreement in place.\nBased on the services offered by the company, the licensee may represent either\nthe buyer or the seller, or in some arrangements, both. Some companies focus\nonly on buyers while others focus only on sellers. Most companies represent both\nbuyers and sellers. Regardless of which the licensee represents, he or she will act\nfor or represent the client in negotiations with other parties. The licensee must put\nthe client's best interests ahead of the interests of any other party to the\ntransaction.\nIf the licensee represents the seller, he or she is obligated to negotiate the best\nselling price and terms for the seller.

The complete text of\nthis required form, which discusses single agency, dual agency, and transaction\nfacilitation, is found in Section 790-X-3-.13 of Alabama Real Estate License\nLaw. The broker must provide the disclosure form to the consumer before any\nconfidential information is exchanged and before the licensee provides any\nbrokerage services. The consumer then has the option of signing an agreement\nwith the broker or not and deciding what service arrangement will work best for\nhim or her. Consumers are not required to sign this form, but if the consumer\nrefuses, the licensee should make a note of the refusal on the form.\nOffer to purchase\nrequired language All offers to purchase must prominently contain a representation disclosure\nclause using prescribed language, which states the type of agency being\npracticed. This applies to both listing and selling licensees.\nAgency disclosure\noffice policy RECAD also requires all qualifying brokers to adopt and maintain an agency\ndisclosure office policy that sets the types of brokerage services his or her own\ncompany may offer or accept. Qualifying brokers are required to explain the\noffice policy to all licensees at least once a year. Licensees are required to sign a\nform acknowledging receipt of the company's policy statement and must also\nprovide the office policy disclosure to consumers so the consumer is fully\ninformed. This policy must include an explanation of how the real estate\ncompany and the brokers are compensated.\nRemember that Alabama licensees are only permitted to engage in services\noffered by the company and qualifying broker. Therefore, by setting an office\npolicy as to the services to be provided, the qualifying broker is assuring that the\nassociated licensees understand what services they may engage in and what\nservices they may not. Licensees engaging in services not included in the office\npolicy are violating the law.\nNon-agency\ndisclosure At the first contact between a licensee and a real estate consumer, the licensee is\nnot considered an agent of that consumer.

The law does not require the licensee to\nengage in any or all of the broker arrangements specified in the law, but the\nlicensee must inform the consumer that they exist.\nThe licensee is to use the Brokerage Services Disclosure form to explain the\navailable services to the consumer. As explained previously, use of the form is\nmandatory but the consumer's signature on the form is not required. Remember\nthat the disclosure must be provided at the initial contact with the consumer or as\nsoon as reasonably possible.\nCustomer or client The difference between a customer and a client is whether or not an agency\nagreement has been signed to obtain brokerage services.\nA customer is a person who is obtaining brokerage services from a licensee but\nhas not signed an agency agreement with the licensee or company. A client, on\nthe other hand, is a person who has signed an agency agreement with the licensee\nor company for specific brokerage services.\nThe licensee has obligations to both customers and clients. Many of the\nobligations are the same for both, but additional obligations are owed to a client.\nBrokerage\nrelationships RECAD allows a qualifying broker to offer services as a single agency, dual\nagency, and transaction facilitation. The qualifying broker is not required to offer\nall of these services, nor is he or she limited to offering only one of the services.\nTransaction facilitation. In this arrangement, the broker works with one or more\nparties in the same transaction without becoming an agent or fiduciary to any of\nthe parties. The transaction facilitator provides services to customers with or\nwithout a written agreement. The broker can act as an intermediary between the\nbuyer and the seller, providing neutral third-party services to both parties. The\ntransaction facilitator is not an agent and does not perform the same services as\nan agent. This is a non-agency relationship in which the broker's services are not\nfiduciary. This is also a relationship in which the broker has reduced liability.\nBuyers and sellers are customers and not clients because neither has signed an\nagency agreement with the broker. A seller would employ the broker to market\nhis or her property and show it to prospective buyers. The seller would also use\nthe broker's expertise in preparing the property for sale and determining an\nappropriate selling price. A buyer would use the broker to find and show suitable\nproperties that meet the buyer's needs and wishes. The buyer may also seek the\ntransaction broker's help in obtaining financing for the property and in finalizing\nthe sale and recording the deed.\nTransaction facilitation arrangements typically work best for consumers who\nneed marketing services and real estate expertise but who do not need an agent to\nhelp with price and terms negotiations.\nChapter 28: Alabama Agency 485",

Under\nAlabama law, the licensee is required to exercise reasonable care and skill,\nanswer all questions completely and accurately, and present all written offers\npromptly and truthfully. The licensee is also required to keep confidential\ninformation confidential unless disclosure is required under the law. To comply\nwith this requirement, transaction facilitators must completely and honestly\nanswer a buyer's questions about the condition of the property and must tell the\nbuyer about any hidden defects the broker knows about that could impact the\nhealth or safety of occupants.\nIf a qualifying broker offers transaction facilitator services by written agreement,\nthe agreement form must be included in the agency disclosure office policy.\nSingle agency. The single agent represents only one party in a transaction, and\nthat party is the agent's client. The client may be the seller or the buyer but not\nboth. A written agency agreement is required for the qualifying broker and/or the\nlicensee to become a single agent.\nA single agency brokerage arrangement works best for consumers who need\nadvice and help negotiating from a real estate professional. The consumer may\nalso need the licensee's marketing services. Buyers who are moving to a new area\nwhere they are unfamiliar with the local market conditions would benefit from a\nsingle agency agreement.\nIn this arrangement, the licensee is the client's agent and must represent only the\nclient in negotiations with other parties. The licensee must seek the best price and\nsale terms for his or her client. The agent is required to be completely loyal and\nfaithful to the client.\nDual agency. A licensee who is representing both the buyer and the seller is a\ndual agent. The agent may only represent both parties with their written,\ninformed consent. Dual agency is illegal in many states but is allowed in\nAlabama as long as the involved parties consent to the arrangement.\nDual agency is used when one licensee represents both the buyer and the seller in\nthe same transaction. The agent is required to be loyal and faithful to both clients\nexcept where the duties owed to the clients conflict.\nIn some states, if two or more salesperson under the same qualifying broker each\nrepresent a different party to the same transaction, it is a form of dual agency. In\nAlabama, however, both licensees are single agents. The qualifying broker and\nany other licensees involved in the transaction are assumed to not have any\nknowledge about the other party, even though the licensees are at the same real\nestate company.\nDual agency is common in larger real estate markets where companies have\nmany properties listed for sale, properties in which their own represented buyers\nmay be interested. With the dual agency agreement, agents representing sellers\ncan show properties to buyers they also represent.\nThe primary function of the licensee in a dual agency is to help both parties reach\nmutually satisfactory terms and price. The dual agent must not show favortism to\n486 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

These rights\nare included in the law as the licensee's obligations to both customers and to\nclients.\nAdditionally, Alabama is one of ten states that have mandated the consumer's\nrights by requiring real estate brokers to provide buyers, sellers, landlords, and\ntenants a minimum level of services. This mandate includes helping the consumer\nnegotiate, presenting and receiving offers, and answering questions. The idea\nbehind this law is that real estate consumers need to be able to expect certain\nservices from a broker hired to represent them and that laws are necessary to\nguarantee a minimum level of service, thereby giving consumers legal rights\nwhen being represented in a real estate transaction.\nLicensee duties\nto customers If a consumer does not sign an agency agreement or brokerage service\nagreement, the consumer is a customer and not a client. However, the licensee\nstill has obligations to customers.\nOne of the first obligations is to provide the customer with a copy of the Real\nEstate Brokerage Services Disclosure form and the agency disclosure office\npolicy. The disclosure form outlines the types of representation that are available\nin Alabama, and the office policy describes the brokerage services provided at\nthat specific real estate company. Allow the customer to ask any questions he or\nshe has regarding the services. The agency disclosure office policy must also\noutline how the licensee and real estate company will be paid. The AREC\nrequires the licensee to sign, date, and provide the consumer with a copy of the\nBrokerage Service Disclosure form and the agency disclosure office policy. Both\nforms must be provided before the licensee lists a property or makes an offer on\nthe person\u2019s behalf.\nAlabama law also imposes the following obligations or duties on all real estate\nlicensees to all consumers, regardless of their relationship:\n\uf034 to provide services honestly and in good faith\n\uf034 to exercise reasonable care and skill in providing services\n\uf034 to keep confidential any information obtained in confidence or any\ninformation the licensee knows should be kept confidential, unless\ndisclosure is required by the law or by the duty to a client, unless\nChapter 28: Alabama Agency 487",

Typically, the misrepresentation would be on the seller's part to\npersuade the buyer to actually purchase the property. Misrepresentation\ngenerally applies only to statements of fact and not to opinions or predictions. It\ncan also occur through omission or failure to disclose material facts.\nBecause there is a duty to correct any false statements or omissions, failure to\nmake the correction is also considered misrepresentation, or, more specifically,\nnegligent misrepresentation.\nMisrepresentation is the lawsuit that brokers face the most. The second lawsuit\nbrokers face most often is the failure to disclose. Misrepresentation can be\nclassified as innocent, negligent, and fraudulent. Negligent misrepresentation\nincludes not disclosing significant property defects out of ignorance. Fraudulent\nmisrepresentation is purposefully hiding a property defect just to make the sale.\nConsequently, honest and timely disclosures are the best way to avoid being\nguilty of misrepresentation. However, what about caveat emptor? Does that\neliminate the chance of being liable for misrepresentation?\nChapter 28: Alabama Agency 489",

    "text": "Caveat emptor and property disclosures. Caveat emptor is a Latin term\nmeaning \"let the buyer beware.\" This phrase also implies that the seller has no\nactual duty to disclose issues with the property's physical condition to the buyer \u2013\nall of that is up to the buyer. The burden of examining the property before\npurchase falls on the buyer and, the responsibility for the property's condition is\nplaced on the buyer.\nMany states do not employ the rule of caveat emptor. Rather, they require sellers\nto formally disclose issues with the property, usually with an approved disclosure\nform. Alabama, however, is not one of those states. It uses the rule of caveat\nemptor for the sale of used residential property. There are exceptions to the rule\nin Alabama:\n\uf034 if a fiduciary relationship exists between the buyer and the seller,\nmeaning there is a legal responsibility to act in the best interest of\nthe other party, such as the seller's doctor is the buyer\n\uf034 if the seller knows the property may pose a health or safety risk to\nthe buyer, meaning if the seller knows the home has lead paint or\nasbestos\n\uf034 if the buyer asks direct questions to the seller on specific defects,\nmeaning if the buyer asks about a defect such as pest infestations\nIn any of these exceptions, the seller must disclose those defects of which he or\nshe is familiar. If the seller fails to disclose the known material defects to the\nbuyer, the seller may be liable for damages. The buyer who later discovers the\ndefect would be able to sue the seller for misrepresentation.\nHowever, under Alabama's caveat emptor law, the failure to disclose a known\ndefect may not be sufficient grounds on which to hold the seller liable. The buyer\nwould need to prove that the seller knew that the specific defect posed a direct\nthreat to the buyer's health or safety. For example, the buyer would have to prove\nthat the seller knew the buyer was allergic to a particular product or substance\ncontained in the home. That's fairly difficult to prove in most cases.\nNotice above that Alabama uses the rule in the sale of used residential property.\nBecause new homes have an implied warranty of habitability by the builder, the\nrule of caveat emptor is not applied to new homes. However, for the home to\nmeet the requirements of the implied warranty in a liability case, the buyer must\nshow six things:\n1. the buyer purchased a new home from the seller\n2. the seller built the home\n3. the home was not inhabited by any other person before the buyer's\npurchase\n4. the home was built by the seller for the purpose of sale and was\nsold to the buyer in a defective condition which impaired the\nhome's intended use\n490 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The seller's agent should also insist the defects be\ndisclosed to avoid being held liable for misrepresentation.\nPossibly the best way to disclose the defects and avoid misrepresentation is to\nhave the seller complete a property disclosure form and give it to the buyer prior\nto closing. Most Alabama agents provide the form to the seller for completion at\nthe time the seller lists the property with the agent. The agent can then provide a\ncopy of the completed form to the potential buyer. Alabama sellers are not\nrequired to complete or provide the disclosure form but doing so is the best way\nof making all disclosures that are legally required.\nMisrepresentation and broker liability. Alabama law holds that a client is not\nliable for misrepresentation which is made by the broker while providing\nbrokerage services to the client unless the client knows or should have known\nabout the misrepresentation. The client can be held liable for a misrepresentation\nmade by the broker if the broker is repeating a misrepresentation made by the\nclient to the broker. For example, a client knows his property contains asbestos\nbut lies about that to the agent. Then, if the agent fails to disclose the asbestos to\nthe buyer because the agent is repeating the client's misrepresentation, the client\ncan be held liable for that misrepresentation.\nAlabama law also holds that a licensee is not liable for providing false\ninformation if the information was provided by the client, a customer, or another\nlicensee. If the licensee knows or should have known the information was false,\nthen he or she can be held liable.\nEven with the rule of caveat emptor, there are times when a real estate broker can\nand will be held liable for misrepresentation. Purchasers who discover physical\ndefects in the property after the transaction has closed may want to recover their\nlosses from the real estate broker who handled the transaction. Honest and\nthorough disclosure is the best way to avoid these situations.\nLISTINGS\nRequired listing services. Alabama license law mandates specific requirements to\nbe met by a listing agent when working with a property seller and the seller's\nagent. The law states the following:\n\"When accepting an agreement to list an owner\u2019s property for sale,\nthe broker or his or her licensee shall, at a minimum, accept\ndelivery of and present to the consumer all offers, counteroffers,\nand addenda to assist the consumer in negotiating offers,\nChapter 28: Alabama Agency 491",

The seller may negotiate\nlisting agreements that meet his or her individual needs, knowledge, and\nexperience. The seller may choose to receive any offers directly from a selling\nagent and may have his or her contact information made available for this\npurpose. In making this choice, the seller is relieving the listing agent of the duty\nto prepare and provide an estimated closing statement, which is required when an\noffer on a single-family residential property comes through the listing agent. The\nselling agent, however, is still required to provide an estimated closing statement\nto the potential buyer. The selling agent is not required to provide the estimated\nclosing statement to the seller since the selling agent is only transmitting the offer\nand not presenting it to the seller. The selling agent is also not required to answer\nthe seller's questions; that is the responsibility of the listing agent.\nSellers may also choose to control the use of their property when it comes to\nsignage. The seller may allow the listing agent to provide and post signage on the\nlisted property, or the seller may choose to use his or her own signage. The seller\ncan choose to have both the agent's sign and the seller's sign on the property or no\nsigns at all.\nIn any listing where the seller is exercising his or her rights to negotiate\nbrokerage services and arrangements, the licensee should consult with the\nqualifying broker to ensure that office policies are being followed.\n492 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",
