Mechanics of a
loan transaction It is common to use borrowed money to purchase real estate. When a borrower
gives a note promising to repay the borrowed money and executes a mortgage on
the real estate for which the money is being borrowed as security, the financing
method is called mortgage financing. The term "mortgage financing" also applies
to real estate loans secured by a deed of trust. The process of securing a loan by
pledging a property without giving up ownership of the property is called
hypothecation.
States differ in their interpretation of who owns mortgaged property. Those that
regard the mortgage as a lien held by the mortgagee (lender) against the property
owned by the mortgagor (borrower) are called lien-theory states. Those that
regard the mortgage document as a conveyance of ownership from the mortgagor
to the mortgagee are called title-theory states. Some states interpret ownership of
mortgaged property from a point of view that combines aspects of both title and
lien theory.
A valid mortgage or trust deed financing arrangement requires
 a note as evidence of the debt
 the mortgage or trust deed as evidence of the collateral pledge
Note. In addition to executing a mortgage or trust deed, the borrower signs a
promissory note for the amount borrowed. The amount of the loan is typically the
difference between the purchase price and the down payment. A promissory note
creates a personal liability for the borrower to repay the loan.

Mortgage. A mortgage is a legal document stating the pledge of the borrower
(the mortgagor) to the lender (the mortgagee). The mortgage document pledges
the borrower's ownership interest in the real estate in question as collateral
against performance of the debt obligation.

The deed of trust. A deed of trust conveys title to the property in question from
the borrower (trustor) to a trustee as security for the loan. The trustee is a third
party fiduciary to the trust. While the loan is in place, the trustee holds the title
on behalf of the lender, who is the beneficiary of the trust. On repayment of the
loan, the borrower receives the title from the trustee in the form of a deed of
reconveyance.

components
of a loan The financial components of a mortgage loan include:
 principal
 interest and interest rate
 points
 term
 payments
Principal. The capital amount borrowed, on which interest payments are
calculated, is the original loan principal. In an amortizing loan, part of the
principal is repaid periodically along with interest, so that the principal balance
decreases over the life of the loan. At any point during the life of a mortgage
loan, the remaining unpaid principal is called the loan balance, or remaining
balance.
Interest and interest rate. Interest is a charge for the use of the lender's money.
Interest may be paid in advance at the beginning of the payment period, or in
arrears at the end of the payment period, according to the terms of the note.
Mortgage interest is most commonly paid in arrears. The interest rate is a
percentage applied to the principal to determine the amount of interest due. The
rate may be fixed for the term of the loan, or it may be variable, according to the
terms of the note. A loan with a fixed interest rate is called a fixed-rate loan; a
loan with a variable interest rate is commonly called an adjustable rate loan.
Because the interest rate on a mortgage loan does not reflect the full cost of the
loan to the borrower, federal law requires a lender on a residential property to
compute and disclose an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) that includes other
finance charges in addition to the basic interest rate in the calculation.
Chapter 17: Real Estate Finance 251
---PAGE_BREAK---
Many states have laws against usury, which is the charging of excessive interest
rates on loans. Such states have a maximum rate that is either a flat rate or a
variable rate tied to an index such as the prime lending rate.
Points. From the point of view of a lender or investor, the amount loaned in a
mortgage loan is the lender's capital investment, and the interest paid by the
borrower is the return earned by the invested capital. It is often the case that a
lender needs to earn a greater return than the interest rate alone provides. For
example, a lender may require additional yield on a low-interest VA loan which
has an interest rate maximum. In such a case, the lender charges up-front
discount points to make up the difference between the interest rate on the loan
and the required return. This effectively raises the yield of the loan to the lender.
A discount point is one percent of the loan amount. Thus, one point on a
$100,000 loan equals $1,000. The lender charges this as pre-paid interest at
closing by funding only the face amount of the loan minus the discount points.
The borrower, however, must repay the full loan amount, along with interest
calculated on the full amount.
The value of one discount point to a lender is usually estimated to be equivalent
to raising the interest rate on the loan by 1/8%. Thus, a lender has to charge eight
points to raise the yield by 1%. If a lender needs to earn 7% on a loan offered at
6.5%, the number of points necessary would be figured as follows:
7.0% - 6.5% = .5%
.5% x 8 (points per 1%) = 4 points
On a loan of $100,000, the 4 points would cost the borrower:
100,000 x .04 = $4,000.
The borrower would effectively receive from the lender $96,000, and owe
principal and interest based on $100,000. For tax reasons, it is usually advisable
for the borrower to receive the full loan amount from the lender and pay the
points in a check which is separate from that used for other closing costs. As pre-
paid interest, points paid in this way may be deductible on the borrower's income
tax return for the year of the purchase. The borrower should seek the advice of a
tax consultant concerning this matter.
Term. The loan term is the period of time over which the loan must be repaid. A
"30-year loan" is a loan whose balance must be fully paid off at the end of thirty
years. A "five-year balloon loan" is a loan whose balance must be paid off at the
end of five years, although its payments may be calculated on a term of another
length, such as fifteen or thirty years. Such a loan is also sometimes described as
a 30-year loan with a five-year "call."
Payments. The loan term, loan amount, and interest rate combine to determine
the periodic payment amount. When these three quantities are known, it is
possible to identify the periodic payment from a mortgage table or with a
financial calculator. Mortgage payments are usually made on a monthly basis.
On an amortizing loan, a portion of the payment goes to repay the loan balance
in advance, and a portion goes to payment of interest in arrears.
252 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama
---PAGE_BREAK---
For example, Mary and Jerry King borrow $400,000 to finance the purchase of a
home. The loan has a term of thirty years at an interest rate of 5% and is
amortizing. The monthly payment for this loan will be $2,147. For the first
payment at the end of the month, the Kings owe interest on $400,000 for the
monthly period. At 5%, this amounts to $1,666.67. Since their payment is $2,147
and the interest charge is $1,666.67, the difference, which is $480.33, is applied to
an advance payment of principal. The following month, the Kings will pay interest
on the new, smaller loan balance of $399,519.67 ($400,000.00 – 480.33).
If a borrower pays more than the scheduled payment amount, the excess is
credited to repayment of the principal, which is reduced by the amount of the
excess payment. The required minimum payment amount remains constant for
the life of the loan, but the loan term can be reduced by this means, thereby also
reducing the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.
Promissory note A borrower who executes a promissory note is the maker or payer of the note.
The lender is the payee. To be properly executed, all parties who have an interest
in the property should sign the note. The note sets forth:
 the loan amount
 the term of the loan
 the method and timing of repayment
 the interest rate to be paid
 the borrower's promise to pay
The note may also state that it is payable to the bearer, if used with a deed of
trust, or to the mortgagee, if used with a mortgage. Other items in the mortgage
document or deed of trust may be repeated in the promissory note, especially:
 the right to prepay the loan balance
 charges for late payment
 conditions for default
 notifications and cures for default
 other charges
A promissory note is a negotiable instrument, which means the payee may
assign it to a third party. The assignee would then have the right to receive the
borrower's periodic payments.
Mortgage document
and trust deed A borrower who executes a mortgage is a mortgagor. The lender named in the
mortgage is the mortgagee. In a trust deed, the borrower is the trustor and the
lender is beneficiary. The mortgage or trust document identifies the property
being given as security, giving both its legal description and mailing address. The
document contains much of the same information as the note, including:
 the debt amount
 the term of the loan
 method and timing of payments
The document does not usually provide details about the payment amount,
interest rate, or charges.
Chapter 17: Real Estate Finance 253
---PAGE_BREAK---
Among the major clauses of a typical mortgage are the following.
Payment of Principal and Interest: Prepayment and Late Charges. The
borrower must make timely payments according to the terms of the note.
Funds for Taxes and Insurance. Unless waived by the lender or prohibited by
law, the borrower must make monthly payments to cover taxes and hazard
insurance. If applicable, the borrower must also pay flood insurance and
mortgage insurance installments.
Periodic payments of taxes and insurance are held in a reserve fund called the
escrow account. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) limits the
amount of funds that the lender can require and hold for this purpose.
The borrower's monthly payment to the lender for principal and interest is called
the P&I payment (principal and interest). The amount which also includes the
escrow payment is called PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance).
Application of Payments. The amount of each payment is applied to various
items in order of priority. Unless local law provides otherwise, this order is: 1)
prepayment charges; 2) escrow; 3) interest; 4) principal; 5) late charges.
Charges and Liens. The borrower is liable for paying any charges, liens, or other
expenses that may have priority over the mortgage or trust instrument.
Hazard or Property Insurance. The borrower must keep the property insured as
the lender requires to protect the lender’s collateral. Homeowners’ insurance
policies typically provide coverage for losses due to fire, lightning, wind, hail,
explosions, glass breakage, smoke, riots, vandalism, theft, and other perils.
Insurance proceeds, in case of a claim, are applied first to restoring the property,
or, if that is not feasible, to payment of the debt.
Occupancy, Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property. The
borrower must take and maintain occupancy of the property as the borrower's
principal residence according to the lender's requirements. The borrower must not
use or neglect the property in such a way as to impair the lender's lien on the
property. This could include using the property for illegal purposes, creating
hazardous waste on the property, or destroying the improvements.
Protection of Lender's Rights in the Property. The lender may take actions it
believes are necessary to protect its rights in the property if the borrower's actions
threaten them. The costs of these actions would be charged to the borrower, and
become part of the monthly payment.
Mortgage Insurance. The lender may require the borrower to obtain private
mortgage insurance, or PMI. Mortgage insurance protects the lender against
loss of a portion of the loan (typically 20-25%) in case of borrower default.
Private mortgage insurance generally applies to loans that are not backed by the
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or Veterans Administration (VA) and
that have a down payment of less than 20% of the property value.
254 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama
---PAGE_BREAK---
Inspection. With proper notice, the lender may inspect the property if there is
reasonable cause to fear damage to its lien.
Condemnation. If the property is condemned or taken by eminent domain, the
lender declares a claim on any resulting proceeds.
Borrower Not Released; Forbearance by Lender Not a Waiver. The lender
reserves the right to take future action against the borrower for default, even if
the lender decides not to take immediate action. If the lender agrees to change the
terms of the loan, it does not release the borrower from the original liability.
Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. If the borrower
sells or transfers its interest in the property without the lender's approval, the
lender may demand immediate and full repayment of the loan balance. This is an
alienation clause, also known as a due-on-sale clause and a call clause. It allows
the lender to prevent the assumption of the mortgage by a buyer if the borrower
sells the property. The requirement to repay the loan before the scheduled date is
called acceleration.
Borrower's Right to Reinstate. If the lender holds the borrower in default
under the terms of the mortgage and proceeds to enforce its rights under the
document, such as by foreclosing, the borrower has the right to reinstate his or
her interest by performing certain actions. This usually means paying overdue
mortgage payments and any other expenses the lender may have incurred in
protecting its rights. The clause, also known as a redemption clause, gives the
borrower a period of time to satisfy obligations and prevent the lender from
forcing a sale of the property. See foreclosure on page 68 in Chapter Five.
Release. The lender agrees to release the mortgage or trust document to the
borrower when the borrower has paid off the loan and all other sums secured by
the document. The release clause, also known as a defeasance clause, may
specify that the mortgagee will execute a satisfaction of mortgage (also known
as release of mortgage and mortgage discharge) to the mortgagor. In the case
of a deed of trust, the lender as beneficiary requests the trustee to execute a
release deed or deed of reconveyance to the borrower as trustor. The release
deed or satisfaction should be recorded as necessary in county records to show
that the mortgagee/trustee has extinguished all liens against the property.
INITIATING A MORTGAGE LOAN
The loan application
Mortgage loan underwriting
The process of initiating a mortgage loan begins when a borrower completes a
loan application and submits it to a lender for evaluation by the lender's
underwriters.
The loan application Forms. Most lenders use some version of the "Uniform Residential Loan
Application" promulgated by Fannie Mae. This form requests the borrower to
provide information about the property and the borrower. In addition, the
Chapter 17: Real Estate Finance 255
---PAGE_BREAK---
application must include supporting documentation, as indicated in the following
exhibit.
Exhibit 17.3 Property and Borrower Information
Property age & year built year acquired
information original cost current loan balance
Borrower age education
information employment history monthly income & expenses
assets debts
Supporting appraisal report credit report
documentation purchase contract income and employment
verification
The standard form includes the loan amount requested, based on an estimate of
the purchase, refinance, or other underlying transaction.
Completion. The application must be complete for the lender to consider it. The
form must be signed and dated by the applicant(s) and delivered to the lending
institution. The initiation of the application process occurs when the lender
receives the completed application package from the applicant. Federal law
requires the lender to accept all applications and to give applicants notice
concerning the disposition of the application. If the lender denies the loan
application because of fraudulent information on the application form, the
borrower has no claim to a refund of the application fee.
Mortgage loan
underwriting Loan underwriting is the process of assessing the lender's risk in giving a loan.
Mortgage underwriting includes:
 evaluating the borrower's ability to repay the loan
 appraising the value of the property offered as security
 determining the terms of the loan
Risk. A lender undertakes a number of risks in lending money. The principal
risks are that the borrower will default on repayment of the loan, and that the
borrower will damage the value of the property as security. In addition, the
lender runs the risk that, in the event of a foreclosure, the sales proceeds from
the property will be insufficient to cover the lender's loss.
Qualification. A lender assesses risks by examining, or qualifying, both
borrower and property. In qualifying a borrower, an underwriter weighs the
ability of the borrower to repay the loan. This requires an analysis of whether the
borrower's income, cash resources, creditworthiness, net worth, and employment
stability meet the lender's standards.
Loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. In qualifying a property, an underwriter assesses
the ability of the property value to cover potential losses. In this evaluation, a
lender requires that the appraised value of the property be more than adequate to
256 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama
---PAGE_BREAK---
cover the contemplated loan and costs. To protect further against loss, a lender
will usually lend only a portion of the property's value. The relationship of the
loan amount to the property value, expressed as a percentage, is called the loan-
to-value ratio, or LTV. If the lender's loan to value ratio is 80%, the lender will
lend only $80,000 on a home appraised at $100,000. The difference between
what the lender will lend and what the borrower must pay for the property is the
amount the borrower must provide in cash as a down payment.
Even if borrower and property qualify, a lender may, under certain
circumstances, seek further protection against risk by requiring the borrower to
obtain private mortgage insurance. This is frequently the case with loans
requiring a relatively small down payment, leading to a high loan-to-value ratio.
Private mortgage insurance. As mentioned earlier, if a loan's LTV ratio is too
high, a lender may require that the borrower purchase private mortgage insurance,
commonly called PMI. This insurance secures whatever portion of the loan
amount takes the LTV ratio above the typical ratio limit – which is usually 80% of
the property's value. This protects the lender from the borrower's default – which
can become more likely if the borrower has very little equity in the property.
To illustrate, take a $500,000 property with an 90-10% LTV loan on it. At 90%,
this loan would be 90% times $500,000, or $450,000. Next, consider that the
lender requires 20% equity, or an 80-20% LTV. Such an LTV would cap the loan
limit at $400,000. In this case, to get this lender to lend $450,000, the borrower
would have to purchase PMI to insure the "top" portion of the loan, or $50,000.
With this PMI safety net, the lender can lend the funds, and the borrower closes
with a 90-10 LTV loan.
In practice, a borrower who has to obtain PMI must retain the insurance policy
and continue the premium payments until the LTV ratio on the loan has dropped
to within acceptable levels, such as the 80-20 level. This happens by the
property's value appreciating as well as the loan balance being paid off over time.
Finally, if the borrower can assimilate enough funds to pay down the loan balance,
the lender will be obligated to drop the PMI requirement, since, as we have seen, a
prepayment of principal changes the loan-to-value ratio.
QUALIFYING FOR A MORTGAGE LOAN
Equal Credit Opportunity Act
Income qualification
Loan constant
Cash qualification
Net worth
Credit evaluation
Loan commitment
To qualify for a mortgage loan, a borrower must meet the lender's qualifications
in terms of income, debt, cash, and net worth. In addition, a borrower must
demonstrate sufficient creditworthiness to be an acceptable risk.
Chapter 17: Real Estate Finance 257
---PAGE_BREAK---
Equal Credit
Opportunity Act The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) requires a lender to evaluate a loan
applicant on the basis of that applicant's own income and credit rating, unless the
applicant requests the inclusion of another's income and credit rating in the
application. In addition, ECOA has prohibited a number of practices in mortgage
loan underwriting. Accordingly, a lender may not:
 discount or disregard income from part-time work, a spouse, child
support, alimony, or separate maintenance. Further, the loan
officer may not ask whether any of the applicant's income is
derived from these sources.
 assume that income for a certain type of person will be reduced
because of an employment interruption due to child-bearing or
child-raising. The loan officer may not ask about the applicant's
plans or behavior concerning child-bearing or birth control.
 refuse a loan solely on the basis that the security is located in a
certain geographical area.
 ask applicants any question about their age, sex, religion, race or
national origin, except as the law may require.
 require a spouse to sign any document unless the spouse's income
is to be included in the qualifying income, or unless the spouse
agrees to become contractually obligated, or the state requires the
signature for some purpose such as clearing clouded title.
If a lender denies a request for a loan, or offers a loan under different terms than
those requested by an applicant, the lender must give the applicant written notice
providing specific reasons for the action.
Qualifying the borrower. The lender must rely on eight types of information to
determine that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan:
1. current income or assets (excluding the value of the mortgaged
property)
2. current employment status
3. credit history
4. monthly payment for the mortgage
5. monthly payments being made on other loans on the same
property
6. monthly payments for other mortgage-related expenses
7. other debts
8. monthly debt payments compared to monthly income (debt-to-
income ratio)
The lender cannot use a temporarily low rate (introductory or “teaser” rate) to
determine qualification. For an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM), the highest rate
the borrower might have to pay is generally to be used.
258 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama
---PAGE_BREAK---
The “ability to repay” requirements are relaxed in certain circumstances where
the borrower is attempting to refinance from a riskier loan (such as an interest-
only loan) to a less risky one (such as a fixed-rate mortgage loan.
Qualified Mortgage. A Qualified Mortgage is one that meets the “ability-to-
repay” requirements, has certain required features and is not allowed to have
others. There are exceptions to these rules for certain kinds of small lenders.
Issuing a Qualified Mortgage gives the lender certain legal protections in case the
borrower fails to repay the loan.
Generally not allowed:
 an “interest-only” period--when interest, but not principal, is being
repaid
 negative amortization–when principal increases over time
 balloon payment–larger than normal payment at the end of the
loan term
 loan term longer than 30 years
 excessive upfront fees and points
Generally required:
 monthly debt no more than 43 % of monthly pre-tax income
 limits on points
Qualified Mortgages include loans that can be bought by Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac or insured by certain government agencies, such as the Department of
Agriculture, even if the debt ratio is higher than 43 percent. Also, loans that are
insured or guaranteed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
including through the Federal Housing Administration, are qualified mortgages
under rules issued by that agency.
Valuations. Before issuing a first mortgage loan, a lender must
 notify the borrower within three days of the loan application that a
copy of any appraisal will be promptly provided
 provide the borrower with a free copy of any valuation used,
including appraisal reports, automated valuation model reports,
and broker’s price opinions, promptly when completed and no
later than three days before closing
 provide these copies even if the loan does not close
The lender may ask for the deadline to be waived so that the copies may be
delivered at closing, and may charge a reasonable fee for obtaining the valuation.
Discovery and disclosure requirements. Creditors are required to provide
applicants with free copies of all appraisals and other written valuations
developed in connection with an application for a loan to be secured by a first
lien on a dwelling and must notify applicants in writing that copies of appraisals
will be provided to them promptly.
Chapter 17: Real Estate Finance 259
---PAGE_BREAK---
High cost loans. When the annual percentage rate (APR) or points and fees on a
home loan, home equity loan, or home equity line of credit (HELOC) exceed
certain limits, special consumer protections apply. The lender must provide
information in advance that explains the costs, terms, and associated fees, and get
a housing counselor to certify that the borrower has received counseling about the
high-cost mortgage.
With high-cost mortgages, lenders are not allowed to add many kinds of fees and
charges to the loan amount, namely:
 prepayment penalties for early loan payoff
 balloon payments
 late fees larger than 4 percent of the regular payment
 fees for payoff statements (statements of loan balance)
 loan modification fees
Income qualification Lenders want to be assured that the borrower has adequate means to make all
necessary periodic payments on the loan in addition to other housing expenses
and debts such as credit card payments and car payments. Most lenders use two
ratios to estimate an applicant's ability to fulfill a loan obligation: an income
ratio, or housing ratio, and a debt ratio, or housing plus debt ratio. They also
consider the stability of an applicant's income. Please note that the income and
debt ratios in the discussion below do not necessarily reflect the latest ratios used
by FHA, VA, or other lenders. Check for updates on the websites of those
agencies.
Income ratio. The income ratio, or housing expense ratio, establishes borrowing
capacity by limiting the percent of gross income a borrower may spend on
housing costs. Housing costs include principal, interest, taxes, and homeowner's
insurance, and may include monthly assessments, mortgage insurance, and
utilities. The income ratio formula is:
Income Ratio
𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒
=𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜
𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦 𝐺𝑅𝑂𝑆𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒
To identify the maximum monthly housing expense an income ratio allows,
modify the formula as follows:
monthly gross income x income ratio = monthly housing expense
Most conventional lenders require that this ratio be no greater than 25-28%. In
other words, a borrower's total housing expenses cannot exceed 28% of gross
income. For an FHA-backed loan, the ratio is 31%. VA-guaranteed loans do not
use this qualifying ratio.
For example, if a couple has combined monthly gross income of $12,000, and a
lender's maximum income ratio is 28%, the couple's monthly housing expense
cannot exceed $3,360:
260 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama
---PAGE_BREAK---
$12,000 x 28% = $3,360
Debt ratio. The debt ratio considers all of the monthly obligations of the income
ratio plus any additional monthly payments the applicant must make for other
debts. The lender will look specifically at minimum monthly payments due on
revolving credit debts and other consumer loans. The debt ratio formula is:
Debt Ratio
𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒+𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦 𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑡 𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠
=𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜
𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦 𝐺𝑅𝑂𝑆𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒
To identify the housing expenses plus debt a debt ratio allows, modify the
formula as follows:
monthly gross income x debt ratio = monthly housing expense + monthly debt obligations
Most conventional lenders require that this debt ratio be no greater than 36%.
For an FHA-backed loan, the debt ratio may not exceed 43%. The VA uses 41%
and a variable “residual income” calculation. The FHA and VA include in the
debt figure any obligation costing more than $100 per month and any debt with a
remaining term exceeding six months.
Using the 36% debt ratio, the couple whose monthly income is $12,000 will be
allowed to have monthly housing and debt obligations of $4,320:
$12,000 gross income x 36% = $4,320 expenses and debt
VA-guaranteed loans also require a borrower to meet certain qualifications based
on net income after paying federal, state, and social security taxes, housing
maintenance and utilities expenses. Such residual income requirements vary by
family size, loan amount, and geographical region.
Income stability. A lender looks beyond income and debt ratios to assess an
applicant's income stability. Important factors are:
 how long the applicant has been employed at the present job
 how frequently and for what reasons the applicant has changed
jobs in the past
 how likely secondary income such as bonuses and overtime is to
continue on a regular basis
 how educational level, training and skills, age, and type of
occupation may affect the continuation of the present income
level in the future.
Loan constant A loan constant is a pre-calculated, unchanging number that relates the principal
and interest payment amount of a loan to the amount of the loan at a given
interest rate and term.
Chapter 17: Real Estate Finance 261
---PAGE_BREAK---
With the loan constant in hand, one can easily derive
 the amount of a loan from its principal and interest payment
 the amount of the principal and interest payment from the loan
amount .
By way of these calculations, homebuyers can easily determine how much they
can pay per month on a loan or how much loan they can get given their payment
affordability. By extension, they can answer two essential homebuyer questions:
(a) Can I afford to buy that house? And (b) How much house can I afford to buy?
Loan constants are presented as the monthly payment amount in dollars needed to
amortize a loan of a $1,000 for a certain term at a certain interest rate. The
constant must be multiplied by the number of thousands in the loan amount to
derive a monthly payment for a larger loan amount. Loan constants can be found
in readily available loan constant tables, such as the following.
Monthly Payment Needed to Amortize a $1,000 loan (Loan Constant)

Solving for the monthly principal and interest payment (PI). The periodic
principal and interest payment (PI) on an amortized loan is the total of the
payments for interest and principal over that period. In the following examples,
the derived number PI does not include any escrow amounts for taxes or interest.
To derive a monthly payment for a given loan amount, interest rate, and term,
select the loan constant for that loan from the “Monthly Payment Needed to
Amortize a Loan of $1,000” charts. Then multiply the number of thousand
dollar increments in the loan amount (in other words, the loan amount divided by
1,000) by the loan constant.
(Loan amount L ÷ 1,000) x Constant C = Payment PI
or
(L ÷ 1,000) x C = PI

1. A borrower’s interest rate is 5.5% and she needs a 30-year loan in the
amount of $350,000. What will her monthly PI payment be?
Answer
(a) the monthly loan constant C for a 30-year loan at 5.5% is 5.68.
(b) the monthly PI payment for a $350,000 loan = ($350,000 L ÷ 1,000) x
5.68 C = (350 x 5.68 ) = $1,988.00 PI
2. A borrower’s interest rate is 6.0% and she prefers to get a 20-year loan.
To buy the house, she must borrow $280,000. What will her payment be?
Answer
(a) the monthly loan constant C for a 20-year loan at 6.0% is 7.16.
(b) the monthly PI payment for a $280,000 loan L = (280,000 L ÷ 1,000) x
7.16 C = (280 x 7.16) = $2,004.80 PI
Solving for the loan amount. The loan amount in the present context is the
beginning principal balance of the loan.
To derive a loan amount when you know the monthly PI payment, the interest
rate and the term, identify the loan’s constant, divide the PI amount by that
constant, then multiply the result by 1,000.
(Payment PI ÷ Constant C) x 1,000 = Loan amount L
or
(PI ÷ C) x 1,000 = L
1. A borrower’s interest rate is 5.5% and he wants a 30-year loan. His
banker said he could afford to pay $1,988 PI per month. How much can he
borrow at this budget (to the nearest thousand )?
Answer
(a) the monthly loan constant C for a 30-year loan at 5.5% is 5.68.
(b) the loan amount L = payment PI $1,988 ÷ loan constant C 5.68 x 1000
= $350,000 L.
2. A borrower’s interest rate is 6.0% and she prefers to get a 20-year loan.
Her banker said she could afford a monthly PI payment of $2,000. How
much can she borrow with this payment budget?
Answer
(a) the monthly loan constant C for a 20-year loan at 6.0% is 7.16.
(b) the loan amount L = payment PI $2,000 ÷ loan constant C 7.16 x
1,000 = $279,329, or $280,000 rounded.

Cash qualification Since a lender lends only part of the purchase price of a property according to the
lender's loan-to-value ratio, a lender will verify that a borrower has the cash
resources to make the required down payment. If some of a borrower's cash for
the down payment comes as a gift from a relative or friend, a lender may require
a gift letter from the donor stating the amount of the gift and lack of any
requirement to repay the gift. On the other hand, if someone is lending an
applicant a portion of the down payment with a provision for repayment, a lender
will consider this another debt obligation and adjust the debt ratio accordingly.
This can lower the amount a lender is willing to lend.
Net worth An applicant's net worth shows a lender the depth of the applicant's cash
reserves, the value and liquidity of assets, and the extent to which assets
exceed liabilities. These facts are important to a lender as an indication of the
applicant's ability to sustain debt payment in the event of loss of employment.
Credit evaluation Credit report and credit score. A lender must obtain a written credit report on
any applicant who submits a completed loan application. The credit report will
contain the applicant's history regarding:
 outstanding debts
 payment behavior (timeliness, collection problems)
 legal information of public record (lawsuits, judgments,
bankruptcies, divorces, foreclosures, garnishments,
repossessions, defaults)
Problems with payment behavior and legal actions are likely to cause a lender to
deny the application, unless the applicant can provide an acceptable explanation
of mitigating and temporary circumstances that caused the problem.
If a lender denies a loan on the basis of a credit report, the lender must disclose
in writing that the applicant is entitled to a statement of reason from any creditor
responsible for the negative report.
Since 1995, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal
National Mortgage Association have been encouraging lenders to use credit
scoring to evaluate loan applicants. Credit scoring is a computer-based method
of assigning a numerical value to an applicant's credit. The credit score is a
statistical prediction of a borrower's likelihood of defaulting on a loan.
Loan commitment When a lender's underwriters have qualified an applicant and the lender has
decided to offer the loan, the lender gives the applicant a written notice of the
agreement to lend under specific terms. This written promise is the loan
commitment. The commitment may take a number of common forms, including
a firm commitment, a lock-in commitment, a conditional commitment, and a
take-out commitment.
A firm commitment is a straight forward offer to make a specific loan at a
specific interest rate for a specific term. This kind of commitment is the one most
commonly offered to home buyers.
A "lock-in" commitment is an offer to lend a specific amount for a specific
term at a specific interest rate, but the interest rate is subject to an expiration
264 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama
---PAGE_BREAK---
date, for instance, sixty days. This guarantees that the lender will not raise the
interest rate during the application and closing periods. The borrower may have
to pay points or some other charge for the lock-in.
A conditional commitment offers to make a loan if certain provisions are met.
This kind of commitment generally applies to construction loans. A typical
condition for funding the loan is completion of a development phase.
A take-out commitment offers to make a loan that will "take out" another
lender's loan, i.e., pay it off and replace it. The take-out loan is most often used to
retire a construction loan. The take-out lender agrees to pay off the short-term
construction loan by issuing a long-term permanent loan.
CLOSING A LOAN
Closing of a mortgage loan normally occurs with the closing of the real estate
transaction. At the real estate closing, the lender typically has deposited the funded
amount with an escrow agent, along with instructions for disbursing the funds.
The borrower deposits necessary funds with the escrow agent, executes final
documents, and receives signed copies of all relevant documents.
Title to the mortgaged property is transferred and recorded according to legal
procedures in effect at the time of closing. The borrower receives a package
containing copies of all documents relevant to the transaction.
LAWS AFFECTING MORTGAGE LENDING
Truth-in-Lending and Regulation Z
Equal Credit Opportunity Act
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act
National Flood Insurance Act
Truth-in-Lending
and Regulation Z The Consumer Credit Protection Act, enacted in 1969 and since amended by the
Truth-in-Lending Simplification and Reform Act, is implemented by the Federal
Reserve's Regulation Z. Regulation Z applies to all loans secured by a residence.
It does not apply to commercial loans or to agricultural loans over $25,000. Its
provisions cover the disclosure of costs, the right to rescind the credit transaction,
advertising credit offers, and penalties for non-compliance with the act.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
(Dodd-Frank Act) established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB.) to protect consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws.
The CFPB consolidates most Federal consumer financial protection authority in
one place, including enforcement of RESPA, ECOA, and Truth in Lending.
Disclosure of costs. Under Regulation Z, a lender must disclose all finance
charges as well as the true Annualized Percentage Rate (APR) in advance of
closing. A lender does not have to show the total interest payable over the loan
term or include in finance charges such settlement costs as fees for appraisal,
Chapter 17: Real Estate Finance 265
---PAGE_BREAK---
title, credit report, survey, or legal work. Disclosure must be distinctly presented
in writing.
Rescission. A borrower has a limited right to cancel the credit transaction,
usually within three days of completion of the transaction. The right of rescission
does not apply to "residential mortgage transactions," that is, to mortgage loans
used to finance the purchase or construction of the borrower's primary residence.
However, state law may require a rescission period and notice on these
transactions as well.
Advertising. Any type of advertising to offer credit is subject to requirements of
full disclosure if it includes:
 a down payment percentage or amount
 an installment payment amount
 a specific amount for a finance charge
 a specific number of payments
 a specific repayment period
 a statement that there is no charge for credit
If any of these items appears in the advertising, the lender must disclose the down
payment amount or percentage, repayment terms, the APR, and whether the rate
can be increased after consummation of the loan.
Noncompliance. Willful violation of Regulation Z is punishable by
imprisonment of up to a year and/or a fine of up to $5,000. Other violations may
be punished by requiring payment of court costs, attorneys' fees, damages, and a
fine of up to $1,000.
Equal Credit
Opportunity Act ECOA prohibits discrimination in extending credit based on race, color, religion,
national origin, sex, marital status, age, or dependency upon public assistance. A
creditor may not make any statements to discourage an applicant on the basis of
such discrimination or ask any questions of an applicant concerning these
discriminatory items. A real estate licensee who assists a seller in qualifying a
potential buyer may fall within the reach of this prohibition. A lender must also
inform a rejected applicant in writing of reasons for denial within 30 days. A
creditor who fails to comply is liable for punitive and actual damages.
Real Estate
Settlement
Procedures Act RESPA is a federal law which aims to standardize settlement practices and
ensure that buyers understand settlement costs. RESPA applies to purchases of
residential real estate (one- to four-family homes) to be financed by "federally
related" first mortgage loans. Federally related loans include:
 VA- and FHA-backed loans
 other government-backed or -assisted loans
 loans that are intended to be sold to FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA,
or other government-controlled secondary market institutions
 loans made by lenders who originate more than one million
dollars per year in residential loans.
266 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama
---PAGE_BREAK---
In addition to imposing settlement procedures, RESPA provisions prohibit
lenders from paying kickbacks and unearned fees to parties who may have helped
the lender obtain the borrower's business. This would include, for example, a fee
paid to a real estate agent for referring a borrower to the lender.
To assist in informing and educating borrowers, RESPA requires that lenders
provide a loan applicant with a loan information booklet and a loan estimate.
The booklet, produced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, explains
RESPA provisions, general settlement costs, and the required Closing
Disclosure form. The lender must provide the estimate of closing costs within
three days following the borrower's application. RESPA is discussed further in
the chapter on “Closings.”
Disclosures. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) requires lenders
to use two specific forms to disclose settlement costs to the buyer. A lender must
provide a Loan Estimate (H-24) within three days of receiving the loan
application and allow the buyer to see the Closing Disclosure (H-25) three days
before loan consummation. A lender must also provide a buyer with a copy of the
information booklet, “Your Home Loan Toolkit,” concerning mortgage loan,
closing costs and closing procedures. The disclosures specify:
 settlement charges
 title charges
 recording and transfer fees
 reserve deposits required
 tax and insurance escrow deposits required
 any other fees or charges
 total closing costs
The disclosure forms vary, depending on loan type. The costs in the Closing
Disclosure must match those in the Loan Estimate within certain standards. A
sample of the H-25 Closing Disclosure is provided in Chapter 21.
National Flood
Insurance Act Federal law requires that borrowers seeking to finance real estate through
federally related loans obtain flood insurance if the property is located in a
designated flood-hazard area. The Department of Housing and Urban
Development administers a program to subsidize flood insurance for borrowers in
communities that have entered the program and complied with its construction
standards. The Army Corps of Engineers has prepared flood-zone maps for the
entire country.
THE MORTGAGE MARKET
Supply and demand for money
The primary mortgage market
The secondary mortgage market
Role of FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC AND FAMC
Mortgage loans provide borrowers with funds to purchase real estate. Money for
mortgages primarily comes from cash savings of individuals, government, and
Chapter 17: Real Estate Finance 267
---PAGE_BREAK---
businesses. This money may become available through the process of
intermediation, in which funds on deposit with financial institutions are loaned
out to borrowers, or disintermediation, in which the owners of the savings invest
their money directly by making loans or other investments. Government actions
and investor activities affect the supply of money for mortgage loans and
encourage or discourage the market for mortgage loans as an investment.
Supply and demand
for money Money is a limited commodity subject to the effects of supply and demand. The
federal government's monetary policy controls the supply of money in order to
achieve the country's economic goals. An excessive supply of money usually
causes interest rates to fall and consumer prices to rise. Conversely, an excessive
demand for money, such as for mortgage loans, causes interest rates to rise and
prices to fall. Regulation of the money supply addresses these fluctuations with
the aim to control and limit wide swings in the supply and demand cycle. These
efforts, in turn, help to buffer the economy from severe inflationary or
recessionary trends.
Regulating the money supply. The Federal Reserve System regulates the money
supply by means of three methods:
 selling or re-purchasing government securities, primarily
Treasury bills
 changing the reserve requirement for member banks. The
reserve is a percentage of depositors' funds that banks and other
regulated financial institutions may not lend out.
 changing the interest rate, or discount rate, the system charges
member institutions for borrowing funds from the Federal
Reserve System central banks
When the Federal Reserve sells Treasury bills, the money paid for the securities
is removed from the economy's money supply. Conversely, when it repurchases
Treasury bills, the cash paid out to investors puts money back into the economy.
The second control, regulating reserve requirements, effectively restricts how
much money banks can put into the economy through the disbursement of loans.
When the Federal Reserve raises reserve requirements, banks have less money to
lend, decreasing the money supply. When the Fed lowers reserve requirements,
banks have more money to lend, increasing the money supply.
The third control, and perhaps the most effective, is regulation of the discount
rate which member banks must pay to borrow money. If the discount rate goes
up, it becomes more cost-prohibitive to borrow. Therefore the money supply
tightens. If the discount rate is lowered, banks have an incentive to borrow more
money to lend to customers.
The primary
mortgage market The primary mortgage market consists of lenders who originate mortgage
loans directly to borrowers. Primary mortgage market lenders include:
 savings and loans
 commercial banks
 mutual savings banks
268 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama
---PAGE_BREAK---
 life insurance companies
 mortgage bankers
 credit unions
Mortgage brokers are also part of the primary mortgage market, even though
they do not lend to customers directly. Rather, they are instrumental in procuring
borrowers for primary mortgage lenders.
The primary lender assumes the initial risk of the long-term investment in the
mortgage loan. Primary lenders sometimes also service the loan until it is paid
off. Servicing loans entails collecting the borrower's periodic payments,
maintaining and disbursing funds in escrow accounts for taxes and insurance,
supervising the borrower's performance, and releasing the mortgage on
repayment. In many cases, primary lenders employ mortgage servicing
companies, which service loans for a fee.
Portfolio lenders. A primary mortgage market lender may or may not sell its
loans into the secondary market. Many lenders originate loans for the purpose of
retaining the investments in their own loan portfolio. These loans are referred to
as portfolio loans, and lenders originating loans for their own portfolio are called
portfolio lenders. Portfolio lenders are less restricted by the standards and forms
imposed on other lenders by secondary market organizations. In retaining their
portfolio loans, portfolio lenders may vary underwriting criteria and hold
independent standards for down payment requirements and the condition of the
collateral.
The secondary
mortgage market Lenders, investors and government agencies that buy loans already originated by
someone else, or originate loans indirectly through someone else, constitute the
secondary mortgage market.
Secondary mortgage market organizations include:
 Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie
Mae)
 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, or Freddie
Mac)
 Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie
Mae)
 investment firms that assemble loans into packages and sell
securities based on the pooled mortgages
 life insurance companies
 pension funds
 primary market institutions who also invest as secondary lenders
Secondary mortgage market organizations buy pools of mortgages from primary
lenders and sell securities backed by these pooled mortgages to investors. By
selling securities, the secondary market brings investor money into the mortgage
market. By purchasing loans from primary lenders, the secondary market returns
funds to the primary lenders, thereby enabling the primary lender to originate
more mortgage loans.
Chapter 17: Real Estate Finance 269
---PAGE_BREAK---
Exhibit 17.4 Money Flow in the Mortgage Market
Primary lenders make a profit on the sale of loans to the secondary market. The
secondary market acquires a profitable long-term investment without having to
underwrite, originate, and service the loans. Secondary market organizations
customarily hire primary lenders or loan servicing companies to service mortgage
pools.
Secondary market loan requirements. The secondary market only buys loans
that meet established requirements for quality of collateral, borrower and
documentation. Since many primary lenders intend to sell their loans to the
secondary market, the qualification standards of the secondary market limit and
effectively regulate the kind of loans the primary lender will originate.
Role of FNMA
GNMA, FHLMC
AND FAMC As major players in the secondary market, the Federal National Mortgage
Association (FNMA, "Fannie Mae"), Government National Mortgage
Association (GNMA, "Ginnie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(FHLMC, "Freddie Mac") and Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
(FAMC, “Farmer Mac”) tend to set the standards for the primary market.
Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae is a
government-sponsored enterprise, originally organized as a privately-owned
corporation. As a secondary market player, it:
 buys conventional, FHA-backed and VA-backed loans
 gives banks mortgage-backed securities in exchange for blocks
of mortgages
270 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama
---PAGE_BREAK---
 offers lenders firm loan purchase commitments, provided they
conform to Fannie Mae's lending standards
 sells bonds and mortgage-backed securities
 guarantees payment of interest and principal on mortgage-backed
securities
Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae. Ginnie Mae is a
division of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Its purpose is to
administer special assistance programs and to help Fannie Mae in its secondary
market activities. Specifically, GNMA
 guarantees payment on FNMA high-risk, low-yield mortgages
and absorbs the difference in yield between the mortgages and
market rates
 guarantees privately generated securities backed by pools of
VA-and FHA-guaranteed loans
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac is
a government-sponsored enterprise, originally chartered as an corporation in
1970. As a secondary market player, FHLMC buys mortgages and pools them,
selling bonds backed by the mortgages in the open market. Freddie Mac
guarantees performance on FHLMC mortgages.
A federal conservator, the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), now
operates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as conservator with the U.S. Treasury a
majority owner of both organizations.
The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, or Farmer Mac. Farmer
Mac (FAMC) is a federal agency whose central function is to increase the
availability and affordability of credit for American agriculture and American
rural communities. In effect, Farmer Mac is the secondary loan market for
American agricultural businesses. More specifically, Farmer Mac provides rural
lenders and cooperatives with liquidity and lower-cost capital for funding
agricultural assets, businesses and other related capital requirements within the
farming community.
Farmer Mac's central activities within the agricultural credit market include
purchasing ag loans; enhancing USDA loan guarantees; providing credit
guarantees for loans and credit; and providing flexible, wholesale credit for ag
lenders, agribusinesses, and applicable investment firms.

TYPES OF REAL ESTATE LOANS
Conventional loans
FHA-insured loans
VA-guaranteed loans
Common loan structures
Seller financing
Special-purpose loans
Conventional loans A conventional mortgage loan is a permanent long-term loan that is not FHA-
insured or VA-guaranteed. Market rates usually determine the interest rate on
the loan. Because of the lack of insurance or guarantee by a government
agency, the risk to a lender is greater for a conventional loan than for a non-
conventional loan. This risk is usually reflected in higher interest rates and
stricter requirements for the down payment and the borrower's income
qualification. At the same time, conventional loans allow greater flexibility in
fees, rates, and terms than do insured and guaranteed loans.
The primary sources of conventional loans are banks and savings and loan
associations. Other conventional lenders include credit unions, life insurance
companies, pension funds, mortgage bankers, and private individuals.
Various types of lenders specialize in mortgage lending for specific purposes
and type of borrower, such as commercial, construction, or single-family
residential loans.
FHA-insured loans The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is an agency of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD). It does not lend money, but insures
permanent long-term loans made by others. The lender must be approved by the
FHA, and the borrower must meet certain FHA qualifications. In addition, the
property used to secure the loan must meet FHA standards. The FHA insures that
the lender will not suffer significant loss in the case of borrower default. To
provide this security, FHA provides insurance and charges the borrower an
insurance premium. FHA loans typically have a higher loan-to-value ratio than
conventional loans, enabling a borrower to make a smaller down payment.
The basic FHA-insured loan program is the Title II, Section 203(b) program for
loans on one- to four-family residential properties. Among the features of this
program are the following.
FHA mortgage insurance. The FHA determines how much mortgage insurance
must be provided and charges the borrower an appropriate mortgage insurance
premium (MIP). The initial premium is payable at closing or is added to the
borrower's loan balance and financed. Further annual premiums are charged
monthly. The amount of the premium varies according to the loan term and the
applicable loan-to-value ratio.
Borrower default. The FHA reimburses the lender for losses due to default by
the borrower, including costs of foreclosure.
Appraisal. The property must be appraised by an FHA-approved appraiser. The
property must also meet the FHA's standards for type and quality of construction,
neighborhood quality, and other features.
272 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama
---PAGE_BREAK---
Maximum loan amount. The FHA has set maximum loan amounts for over 80
regions. Borrowers within a region are limited to the loan ceiling amount in effect
for the region. In addition, the maximum loan amount is restricted by the loan-to-
value ratios in effect. The maximum FHA-backed loan a borrower can obtain will
be the lesser of the regional ceiling amount or the amount dictated by the loan-to-
value standard. Calculations are based on the lesser of sale price or appraised
value.
Down payment requirement. The minimum down payment for an FHA-backed
loan is based on the lower of the appraised value or the sales price. The present
requirement for single-family residential loans is 3.5%.
Maximum loan term. Thirty years is the maximum length of the repayment
period.
Prepayment privilege. The borrower has the right to pay off the loan at any time
without penalty, provided the lender is given prior notice. The lender may charge
up to 30 days' interest if the borrower provides less than 30 days' notice.
Assumability. FHA-backed loans on owner-occupied properties are assumable if
the buyer is qualified. Lenders and borrowers should check with FHA for current
requirements.
Interest rate. The lender and borrower negotiate the interest rate on an FHA-
backed loan without any involvement by FHA.
Points, fees and costs. The lender may charge discount points, a loan origination
fee, and other such charges. These may be paid by buyer or seller. However, if
the seller pays more than a specified percentage of the costs normally paid by a
buyer, the FHA may regard these as sales concessions and lower the sales price
on which the loan insurance amount is based.
In addition to Section 203(b) loan programs, FHA offers insurance coverage for
other loan products. These include:
 home improvement loans
 subsidized loans for low- and middle-income families
 loans for condominiums
 loans for multi-family projects
 graduated-payment loans
 adjustable-rate loans
VA-guaranteed
loans The Department of Veterans Affairs (formerly Veterans Administration) offers
loan guarantees to qualified veterans. The VA, like the FHA, does not lend
money except in certain areas where other financing is not generally available.
Instead, the VA partially guarantees permanent long-term loans originated by
VA-approved lenders on properties that meet VA standards. The VA's guarantee
enables lenders to issue loans with higher loan-to-value ratios than would
otherwise be possible. The interest rate on a VA-guaranteed loan is usually lower
than one on a conventional loan. The borrower does not pay any premium for the
loan guarantee, but does pay a VA funding fee at closing.
Chapter 17: Real Estate Finance 273
---PAGE_BREAK---
Borrower default. The VA reimburses the lender for losses up to the guaranteed
amount if foreclosure sale proceeds fail to cover the loan balance.
Appraisal. The property must be appraised by a VA-approved appraiser. The VA
issues a Certificate of Reasonable Value which creates a maximum value on
which the VA-guaranteed portion of the loan will be based. The property must
meet certain VA specifications.
Down payment requirement. The VA usually requires no down payment,
although the lender may require one.
Maximum loan amount. The VA does not cap the loan amount, but it does limit
the liability it can assume, which usually influences the amount an institution will
lend. The amount a qualified veteran with full entitlement can borrow without
making a downpayment determines the practical loan limits. This amount varies
by county. The basic entitlement available to each eligible veteran is $36,000.
Lenders will generally lend a maximum of 4 times that amount without a down
payment if the veteran is fully qualified and the property appraises for the asking
price.
A veteran must apply for a Certificate of Eligibility to find out how much the VA
will guarantee in a particular situation.
Maximum loan term. The maximum loan term for one- to four-family residences
is 30 years. For loans secured by farms, the maximum loan term is 40 years.
Prepayment privilege. The loan may be paid off early without penalty.
Assumability. VA loans are assumable with lender approval. Usually, the person
assuming the loan must have VA eligibility, and the assumption may have to be
approved by the VA.
Interest rate. Lender and borrower negotiate the interest rate for all VA-insured
loans.
Points, fees and costs. The lender may charge discount points, origination fees,
and other reasonable costs. These may be paid by seller (with some limits) or
buyer, but may not be financed. The VA funding fee, however, may be included
in the loan amount. The funding fee is a percentage of the loan amount which
varies based on the type of loan, military category, whether the loan is a first-time
loan, and whether there is a down payment.
Other VA programs. In addition to insuring loans to veterans, the VA may
insure loans for lenders who set up a special account with the VA. The VA may
also actually lend money directly when an eligible veteran cannot find other
mortgage money locally.
Common loan
structures Variations in the structure of interest rate, term, payments, and principal payback
produce a number of commonly recognized loan types. Among these are the
following.
Amortizing loan. Amortization provides for gradual repayment of principal and
payment of interest over the term of the loan. The borrower's periodic payments
to the lender include a portion for interest and a portion for principal. In a fully
amortizing mortgage, the principal balance is zero at the end of the term. In a
274 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama
---PAGE_BREAK---
partially amortizing loan, the payments are not sufficient to retire the debt. At the
end of the loan term, there is still a principal balance to be paid off.
Negatively amortized loan. Negative amortization causes the loan
balance to increase over the term. This occurs if the borrower's periodic
payment is insufficient to cover the interest owed for the period. The
lender adds the amount of unpaid interest to the borrower's loan balance.
Temporary negative amortization occurs on graduated payment loans,
and may occur on an adjustable rate mortgage.
Adjustable and fixed rate loans. Loans may have fixed or variable rates of
interest over the loan term. Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) allow the lender
to change the interest rate at specified intervals and by a specified amount.
Federal regulations place limits, called rate caps, on incremental interest rate
increases and on the total amount by which the rate may be increased over the
loan term.
Senior and junior loans. When there are multiple loans on a single property,
there is an order of priority in the liens which the mortgages create. The first, or
senior, loan generally has priority over any subsequent loans. Second loans are
riskier than first loans because the senior lender will be satisfied first in case of
default. Therefore, interest rates on second mortgages are generally higher than
on first mortgages.
Fixed and graduated payment loans. Loans may have variable payment
amounts over the term of the loan, or a single fixed payment amount. With a
graduated payment mortgage, the payments at the beginning of the loan term are
not sufficient to amortize the loan fully, and unpaid interest is added to the
principal balance. Payments are later adjusted to a level that will fully amortize
the loan's increased balance over the remaining loan term.
Interest-only loan. In an interest-only loan, periodic payments over the loan
term apply only to interest owed, not to principal. At the end of the term, the full
balance must be paid off in a lump-sum, "balloon" payment. Since these loans
have no periodic principal payback, their monthly payments are smaller than
amortizing loans for the same amount at the same rate of interest.
Buydown loan. A buydown loan entails a prepayment of interest on a loan. The
prepayment effectively lowers the interest rate and the periodic payments for the
borrower. Buydowns typically occur in a circumstance where a builder wants to
market a new development to a buyer who cannot quite qualify for the necessary
loan at market rates. By "buying down" a borrower's mortgage, a builder enables
the borrower to obtain the loan. The builder may then pass the costs of the
buydown through to the buyer in the form of a higher purchase price.
Seller financing The seller may provide some or all of the financing for the buyer's purchase. Some
of the most common methods of seller financing are purchase money mortgages,
including the wraparound, and the contract for deed.
Purchase money mortgage. With a purchase money mortgage, the borrower
gives a mortgage and note to the seller to finance some or all of the purchase
price of the property. The seller in this case is said to "take back" a note, or to
Chapter 17: Real Estate Finance 275
---PAGE_BREAK---
"carry paper," on the property. Purchase money mortgages may be either senior
or junior liens.
Wraparound. In a wraparound loan arrangement, the seller receives a junior
mortgage from the buyer, and uses the buyer's payments to make the payments on
the original first mortgage. A wraparound enables the buyer to obtain financing
with a minimum cash investment. It also potentially enables the seller to profit
from any difference between a lower interest rate on the senior loan and a higher
rate on the wraparound loan. A wraparound is possible only if the senior
mortgagee allows it.
Contract for deed. Under a contract for deed arrangement, the seller retains title
and the buyer receives possession and equitable title while making payments
under the terms of the contract. The seller conveys title when the contract has
been fully performed.
Special-purpose
loans Home equity loan. The ostensible purpose of this type of loan is to obtain funds
for home improvement. Structurally, the home equity loan is a junior mortgage
secured by the homeowner's equity, equity in general being the portion of the
property’s value actually owned by the homeowner, expressed as the difference
between the property’s market value and all loan balances outstanding on the
property.
For some lenders, the maximum home equity loan amount is based on the
difference between the property's appraised value and the maximum loan-to-
value ratio the lender allows on the property, inclusive of all existing mortgage
loans. Thus if a home is appraised at $500,000 and the lender's maximum LTV is
80%, the lender will lend a total of $400,000. If the owner's existing mortgage
balance is $325,000, the owner would qualify for a $75,000 home equity loan.
Package loan. A package loan finances the purchase of real estate and personal
property. For example, a package loan might finance a furnished condominium,
complete with all fixtures and decor.
Construction loan. A construction loan finances construction of improvements.
This type of loan is paid out by the lender in installments linked to stages of the
construction process. The loan is usually interest-only, and the borrower makes
periodic payments based on the amount disbursed so far. As short-term, high-risk
financing, the interest rates are usually higher than those for long-term financing.
The borrower is expected to find permanent ("take out") financing elsewhere to
pay off the temporary loan when construction is complete.
Bridge loan. A bridge, or gap, loan is used to cover a gap in financing between
short-term construction financing and long-term permanent financing. For
instance, a developer may have difficulty finding a long-term lender to take out
the construction lender. However, as the construction loan is expensive and must
be paid off as soon as possible, the developer may find an interim lender who will
pay off the construction loan but not agree to a long-term loan.
Participation loan. In a participation loan, the lender participates in the income
and/or equity of the property, in return for giving the borrower more favorable
loan terms than would otherwise be justified. For instance, the borrower makes

smaller periodic payments than the interest rate and loan amount require, and the
lender makes up the difference by receiving some of the property's income. This
type of loan usually involves an income property.
Permanent (take-out) loan. A permanent loan is a long-term loan that "takes
out" a construction or short-term lender. The long-term lender pays off the
balance on the construction loan when the project is completed, leaving the
borrower with a long-term loan under more favorable terms than the construction
loan offered.
Reverse annuity. In a reverse annuity mortgage, a homeowner pledges the
equity in the home as security for a loan which is paid out in regular monthly
amounts over the term of the loan. The homeowner, in effect, is able to convert
the equity to cash without losing ownership and possession.
Blanket. A blanket mortgage is secured by more than one property, such
as multiple parcels of real estate in a development.
