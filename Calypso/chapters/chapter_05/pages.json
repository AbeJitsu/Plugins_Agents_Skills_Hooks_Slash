In effect, an encumbrance is another's right to use or\ntake possession of a legal owner's property, or to prevent the legal owner from\nenjoying the full bundle of rights in the estate.\nAn encumbrance does not include the right of possession and is therefore a\nlesser interest than the owner's freehold interest. For that reason,\nencumbrances are not considered estates. However, an encumbrance can lead\nto the owner's loss of ownership of the property.\nEasements and liens are the most common types of encumbrance. An\neasement, such as a utility easement, enables others to use the property,\nregardless of the owner's desires. A lien, such as a tax lien, can be placed on\nthe property's title, thereby restricting the owner's ability to transfer clear title\nto another party.\nThe two general types of encumbrance are those that affect the property's use\nand those that affect legal ownership, value and transfer.\nChapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 55",

Easement\nrights may apply to a property's surface, subsurface, or airspace, but the\naffected area must be defined.\nThe receiver of the easement right is the benefited party; the giver of the\neasement right is the burdened party.\nEssential characteristics of easements include the following:\n\uf034 An easement must involve the owner of the land over which\nthe easement runs, and another, non-owning party. One cannot\nown an easement over one's own property.\n\uf034 an easement pertains to a specified physical area within the\nproperty boundaries\n\uf034 an easement may be affirmative, allowing a use, such as a right-\nof-way, or negative, prohibiting a use, such as an airspace\neasement that prohibits one property owner from obstructing\nanother's ocean view\nThe two basic types of easement are appurtenant and gross.\nEasement\nappurtenant An easement appurtenant gives a property owner a right of usage to portions of\nan adjoining property owned by another party. The property enjoying the usage\nright is called the dominant tenement, or dominant estate. The property\ncontaining the physical easement itself is the servient tenement, since it must\nserve the easement use.\n56 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The term appurtenant means \"attaching to.\" An easement appurtenant attaches to\nthe estate and transfers with it unless specifically stated otherwise in the\ntransaction documents. More specifically, the easement attaches as a beneficial\ninterest to the dominant estate, and as an encumbrance to the servient estate. The\neasement appurtenant then becomes part of the dominant estate's bundle of\nrights and the servient estate's obligation, or encumbrance.\nTransfer. Easement appurtenant rights and obligations automatically transfer\nwith the property upon transfer of either the dominant or servient estate,\nwhether mentioned in the deed or not. For example, John grants Mary the right\nto share his driveway at any time over a five-year period, and the grant is duly\nrecorded. If Mary sells her property in two years, the easement right transfers to\nthe buyer as part of the estate.\nNon-exclusive use. The servient tenement, as well as the dominant tenement,\nmay use the easement area, provided the use does not unreasonably obstruct the\ndominant use.\nExhibit 5.2 Easements appurtenant\nThe exhibit shows a conventional easement appurtenant. The driveway marked\nA belongs to parcel #2. An easement appurtenant, marked B, allows parcel #3 to\nuse #2's driveway. Parcel #3 is the dominant tenement, and #2 is the servient\ntenement.\nEasement by necessity. An easement by necessity is an easement appurtenant\ngranted by a court of law to a property owner because of a circumstance of\nnecessity, most commonly the need for access to a property. Since property\ncannot be legally landlocked, or without legal access to a public thoroughfare, a\ncourt will grant an owner of a landlocked property an easement by necessity\nChapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 57",

The landlocked\nparty becomes the dominant tenement, and the property containing the easement\nis the servient tenement.\nIn the exhibit, parcel #1, which is landlocked, owns an easement by\nnecessity, marked C, across parcel #2.\nParty wall easement. A party wall is a common wall shared by two\nseparate structures along a property boundary.\nParty wall agreements generally provide for severalty ownership of half of the\nwall by each owner, or at least some fraction of the width of the wall. In\naddition, the agreement grants a negative easement appurtenant to each owner in\nthe other's wall. This is to prevent unlimited use of the wall, in particular a\ndestructive use that would jeopardize the adjacent property owner's building.\nThe agreement also establishes responsibilities and obligations for maintenance\nand repair of the wall.\nFor example, Helen and Troy are adjacent neighbors in an urban housing\ncomplex having party walls on property lines. They both agree that they\nseparately own the portion of the party wall on their property. They also grant\neach other an easement appurtenant in their owned portion of the wall. The\neasement restricts any use of the wall that would impair its condition. They also\nagree to split any repairs or maintenance evenly.\nOther structures that are subject to party agreements are common fences,\ndriveways, and walkways.\nEasement in gross An easement in gross is a personal right that one party grants to another to use\nthe grantor's real property. The right does not attach to the grantor's estate. It\ninvolves only one property, and, consequently, does not benefit any property\nowned by the easement owner. There are no dominant or servient estates in an\neasement in gross. An easement in gross may be personal or commercial.\n58 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The\nright is irrevocable during this period, but terminates on the grantee's death. It\nmay not be sold, assigned, transferred, or willed. A personal gross easement\ndiffers from a license in that the grantor of a license may revoke the usage right.\nThe exhibit shows that a beachfront property owner (A) has granted a neighbor\n(B) across the street the right to cross A's property to reach the beach.\nCommercial. A commercial easement in gross is granted to a business entity\nrather than a private party. The duration of the commercial easement is not tied to\nanyone's\nlifetime. The right may by assigned, transferred, or willed.\nExamples of commercial gross easements include:\n\uf034 a marina's right-of-way to a boat ramp\n\uf034 a utility company's right-of-way across a lot owners' property to\ninstall and maintain telephone lines (as illustrated in the exhibit).\nEasement creation An easement may be created by voluntary action, by necessary or\nprescriptive operation of law, and by government power of eminent\ndomain.\nVoluntary. A property owner may create a voluntary easement by express grant\nin a sale contract, or as a reserved right expressed in a deed.\nNecessity.

A survey may\nbe required to detect or demonstrate the existence of an encroachment.\nAn owner may sue for removal of an encroachment or for compensation for\ndamages. If an encroached owner takes no remedial action over a prescribed\nnumber of years, the encroachment may become an easement by prescription.\nLICENSES\nA license, much like a personal easement in gross, is a personal right that a\nproperty owner grants to another to use the property for a specific purpose.\nLicenses are not transferrable and do not attach to the land. They cease on the\ndeath of either party, or on the sale of the property.\nUnlike a personal easement in gross, a license is revocable at any time. Licenses\nare often granted informally, as a verbal statement of permission.\nA farmer granting a neighbor permission to cross his land to reach and fish in\nhis pond is an example of a license.\nDEED RESTRICTIONS\nA deed restriction is a limitation imposed on a buyer's use of a\nproperty by stipulation in the deed of conveyance or recorded\nsubdivision plat.\nChapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 61",

Subsequent re-sales of properties within the subdivision are thereby subject\nto the plat's covenants and conditions.\nA private party who wants to control the quality and standards of a property\ncan establish a deed restriction. Deed restrictions take precedence over\nzoning ordinances if they are more restrictive.\nDeed restrictions typically apply to:\n\uf034 the land use\n\uf034 the size and type of structures that may be placed on the property\n\uf034 minimum costs of structures\n\uf034 engineering, architectural, and aesthetic standards, such as\nsetbacks or specific standards of construction\nDeed restrictions in a subdivision, for example, might include a minimum size\nfor the residential structure, setback requirements for the home, and prohibitions\nagainst secondary structures such as sheds or cottages.\nDeed restrictions are either covenants or conditions. A condition can only\nbe created within a transfer of ownership. If a condition is later violated, a\nsuit can force the owner to forfeit ownership to the previous owner. A\ncovenant can be created by mutual agreement. If a covenant is breached, an\ninjunction can force compliance or payment of compensatory damages.\nLIENS\nLien types\nLien priority\nSuperior liens\nJunior liens\nA lien is a creditor's claim against personal or real property as security for a debt\nof the property owner. If the owner defaults, the lien gives the creditor the right\nto force the sale of the property to satisfy the debt.\nFor example, a homeowner borrows $5,000 to pay for a new roof. The lender\nfunds the loan in exchange for the borrower's promissory note to repay the loan.\nAt the same time, the lender places a lien on the property for $5,000 as security\nfor the debt. If the borrower defaults, the lien allows the lender to force the sale\nof the house to satisfy the debt.\nThe example illustrates that a lien is an encumbrance that restricts free and clear\nownership by securing the liened property as collateral for a debt. If the owner\nsells the property, the lienholder is entitled to that portion of the sales proceeds\nneeded to pay off the debt. In addition, a defaulting owner may lose ownership\naltogether if the creditor forecloses.\n62 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "In addition to restricting the owner's bundle of rights, a recorded lien\neffectively reduces the owner's equity in the property to the extent of the lien\namount.\nThe creditor who places a lien on a property is called the lienor, and the debtor\nwho owns the property is the lienee.\nLiens have the following legal features:\n\uf034 a lien does not convey ownership, with one exception\nA lienor generally has an equitable interest in the property, but\nnot legal ownership. The exception is a mortgage lien on a\nproperty in a title-theory state.

In addition, the creditor may\ntake foreclosure action against the new owner for satisfaction of\nthe debt.\n\uf034 a property may be subject to multiple liens\nThere may be numerous liens against a particular property. The\nmore liens there are recorded against property, the less secure the\ncollateral is for a creditor, since the total value of all liens may\napproach or exceed the total value of the property.\n\uf034 a lien terminates on payment of the debt and\nrecording of documents\nPayment of the debt and recording of the appropriate satisfaction\ndocuments ordinarily terminate a lien. If a default occurs, a suit\nfor judgment or foreclosure enforces the lien. These actions force\nthe sale of the property.\nLien types Liens may be voluntary or involuntary, general or specific, and superior or inferior.\nVoluntary and involuntary. A property owner may create a voluntary lien to\nborrow money or some other asset secured by a mortgage. An involuntary lien\nis one that a legal process places against a property regardless of the owner's\ndesires.\nIf statutory law imposes an involuntary lien, the lien is a statutory lien.

A general lien is one placed against any and all real and\npersonal property owned by a particular debtor. An example is an inheritance\ntax lien placed against all property owned by the heir. A specific lien attaches to\na single item of real or personal property, and does not affect other property\nowned by the debtor. A conventional mortgage lien is an example, where the\nproperty is the only asset attached by the lien.\nSuperior and inferior lien. The category of superior, or senior, liens ranks\nabove the category of inferior, or junior, liens, meaning that superior liens\nreceive first payment from the proceeds of a foreclosure. The superior category\nincludes liens for real estate tax, special assessments, and inheritance tax.\nOther liens, including income tax liens, are inferior.\nLien priority Within the superior and inferior categories, a ranking of lien priority determines\nthe order of the liens' claims on the security underlying the debt.

State inheritance tax liens\nJunior liens: priority by date of recording\nFederal income tax liens\nState corporate income tax liens\nState intangible tax liens\nJudgment liens\nMortgage liens\nVendor's liens\nMechanic's liens (by date work was performed)\nBroker\u2019s liens\nAll superior liens take precedence over all junior liens regardless of recording\ndate, since they are considered to be matters of public record not requiring\nfurther constructive notice. Thus, a real estate tax lien (senior) recorded on June\n15 has priority over an income tax lien (junior) recorded on June 1.\nA junior lien is automatically inferior, or subordinate, to a superior lien.\nAmong junior liens, date of recording determines priority. The rule is: the\nearlier the recording date of the lien, the higher its priority. For example, if a\njudgment lien is recorded against a property on Friday, and a mortgage lien is\nrecorded on the following Tuesday, the judgment lien has priority and must be\nsatisfied in a foreclosure ahead of the mortgage lien.\nThe mechanic's lien is an exception to the recording rule. Its priority dates from\nthe point in time when the work commenced or ended, as state law determines,\nrather than from when it was recorded.\nThe following example illustrates how lien priority works in paying off secured\ndebts. A homeowner is foreclosed on a second mortgage taken out in 2018 for\n$25,000. The first mortgage, taken in 2016, has a balance of $150,000. Unpaid\nreal estate taxes for the current year are $1,000. There is a $3,000 mechanic's\nlien on the property for work performed in 2017. The home sells for $183,000.\nChapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 65",

A lienor can change the priority of a junior lien by voluntarily\nagreeing to subordinate, or lower, the lien's position in the hierarchy. This\nchange is often necessary when working with a mortgage lender who will not\noriginate a mortgage loan unless it is senior to all other junior liens on the\nproperty. The lender may require the borrower to obtain agreements from other\nlien holders to subordinate their liens to the new mortgage.\nFor example, interest rates fall from 8% to 6.5% on first mortgages for principal\nresidences. A homeowner wants to refinance her mortgage, but she also has a\nseparate home-equity loan on the house. Since the first-mortgage lender will not\naccept a lien priority inferior to a home equity loan, the homeowner must\npersuade the home equity lender to subordinate the home equity lien to the new\nfirst-mortgage lien.\nSuperior liens Real estate tax lien. The local legal taxing authority annually places a real\nestate tax lien, also called an ad valorem tax lien, against properties as security\nfor payment of the annual property tax. The amount of a particular lien is based\non the taxed property's assessed value and the local tax rate.\nSpecial assessment lien. Local government entities place assessment liens\nagainst certain properties to ensure payment for local improvement projects\nsuch as new roads, schools, sewers, or libraries. An assessment lien applies only\nto properties that are expected to benefit from the municipal improvement.\nFederal and state inheritance tax liens. Inheritance tax liens arise from\ntaxes owed by a decedent's estate. The lien amount is determined through\nprobate and attaches to both real and personal property.\nJunior liens Tax liens. All tax liens other than those for ad valorem, assessment, and estate\ntax are junior liens. They include:\n\uf034 federal income tax lien\nplaced on a taxpayer's real and personal property for failure to\npay income taxes\n66 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

A judgment lien attaches to real and personal property as a\nresult of a money judgment issued by a court in favor of a creditor. The creditor\nmay obtain a writ of execution to force the sale of attached property and collect\nthe debt. After paying the debt from the sale proceeds, the debtor may obtain a\nsatisfaction of judgment to clear the title records on other real property that\nremains unsold.\nDuring the course of a lawsuit, the plaintiff creditor may secure a writ of\nattachment to prevent the debtor from selling or concealing property. In such a\ncase, there must be a clear likelihood that the debt is valid and that the defendant\nhas made attempts to sell or hide property.\nCertain properties are exempt from judgment liens, such as homestead property\nand joint tenancy estates.\nMortgage and trust deed lien. In lien-theory states, mortgages and trust deeds\nsecure loans made on real property. In these states, the lender records a lien as\nsoon as possible after disbursing the funds in order to establish lien priority.\nVendor's lien. A vendor's lien, also called a seller's lien, secures a purchase\nmoney mortgage, a seller's loan to a buyer to finance the sale of a property.\nMunicipal utility lien. A municipality may place a utility lien against a\nresident's real property for failure to pay utility bills.\nMechanic's lien. A mechanic's lien secures the costs of labor, materials, and\nsupplies incurred in the repair or construction of real property improvements. If\na property owner fails to pay for work performed or materials supplied, a worker\nor supplier can file a lien to force the sale of the property and collect the debt.\nAny individual who performs approved work may place a mechanic's lien on the\nproperty to the extent of the direct costs incurred. Note that unpaid\nsubcontractors may record mechanic's liens whether the general contractor has\nbeen paid or not. Thus it is possible for an owner to have to double-pay a bill in\norder to eliminate the mechanic's lien if the general contractor neglects to pay\nthe subcontractors. The mechanic's lienor must enforce the lien within a certain\ntime period, or the lien expires.\nChapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 67",

If a borrower has failed to meet loan obligations in spite\nof proper notice and applicable grace periods, the lender can accelerate the loan,\nor declare that the loan balance and all other sums due on the loan are payable\nimmediately.\nIf the borrower does not pay off the loan in full, the lender then files a\nforeclosure suit, naming the borrower as defendant. The suit asks the court\nto:\n\uf034 terminate the defendant's interests in the property\n\uf034 order the property sold publicly to the highest bidder\n\uf034 order the proceeds applied to the debt\nLis Pendens.

If the sale does not yield sufficient funds to cover the\namounts owed, the mortgagee may ask the court for a deficiency judgment.\nThis enables the lender to attach and foreclose a judgment lien on other real or\npersonal property the borrower owns.\nRight of redemption. The borrower's right of redemption, also called equity of\nredemption, is the right to reclaim a property that has been foreclosed by paying\noff amounts owed to creditors, including interest and costs. Redemption is\npossible within a redemption period. Some states allow redemption during the\nforeclosure proceeding at any time \"until the gavel drops\" at the sale. Other states\nhave statutory periods of up to a year following the sale for the owner of a\nforeclosed property to redeem the estate. Also see right to reinstate on page 255\nin Chapter 17.\nNon-judicial\nforeclosure When there is a \"power of sale\" provision in the mortgage or trust deed\ndocument, a non-judicial foreclosure can force the sale of the liened property\nwithout a foreclosure suit.

There is no redemption\nright in non-judicial foreclosure.\nStrict foreclosure Strict foreclosure is a court proceeding that gives the lender title directly, by\ncourt order, instead of giving cash proceeds from a public sale.\nOn default, the lender gives the borrower official notice. After a prescribed\nperiod, the lender files suit in court, whereupon the court establishes a period\nwithin which the defaulting party must repay the amounts owed. If the defaulter\ndoes not repay the funds, the court orders transfer of full, legal title to the\nlender.\nDeed in lieu of\nforeclosure A defaulting borrower who faces foreclosure may avoid court actions and costs\nby voluntarily deeding the property to the mortgagee. This is accomplished with\na deed in lieu of foreclosure , which transfers legal title to the lienholder. The\ntransfer, however, does not terminate any existing liens on the property.\n70 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Short sale A short sale occurs when a property owner owes more than resale value and loan\npay-off for a property and agrees to let the lender sell the property in exchange\nfor release from the lien. The lender may or may not agree to accept the deficient\nprice as satisfaction and may require the seller to pay the deficiency by way of a\ndeficiency judgment. There may also be tax consequences for the seller. To\navoid the deficiency, the seller must make sure that the agreements include a full\nrelease of the underlying debt and a statement that it was fully satisfied.\nAfter the property is retaken by foreclosure or short sale, it becomes \u201cbank\nowned.\u201d Forbearance or a loan modification allows the borrower to avoid\nlegal action and keep the property under a new agreement with the lender.\nThe parties to a short sale are the buyer and seller. The lender is a third party\ncontingency who must approve the sale. The process is generally as follows.\nShort sale procedure\n1. The borrower or borrower\u2019s agents contact the lender to discuss the short\nsale option.\n2. If willing, the lender sets the required terms of the short sale.\n3. The real estate agent provides the lender a Broker\u2019s Price Opinion (BPO).\n4. The agent lists the property for sale at the price that will cover the\nmortgage.\n5. The agent places a note in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) stating that\nthe lender will consider a short sale.\n6. A buyer submits an offer.\n7. The owner agrees to the contract\n8. The lender approves the short sale.\n9. The transaction closes.\n10. The lender may take action to recover the deficiency.\nChapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 71",
