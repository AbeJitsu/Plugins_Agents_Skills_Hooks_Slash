Preface
About
the text
the text Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama contains the essentials of the national and
Alabama real estate law, principles, and practices necessary for basic competence as a real
estate professional and as mandated by Alabama license law. It is based on our highly
successful and popular national publication, Principles of Real Estate Practice, which is
in use in real estate schools nationwide.
The text is tailored to the needs of the pre-license student. It is designed to
• make it easy for students to learn the material
• prepare students for numerous career applications
• stress practical, as well as theoretical, skills and knowledge.
It is streamlined, direct and to-the-point. It includes multiple learning reinforcements. It has
a student-oriented organization, both within each chapter and from chapter to chapter. Its
examples and exercises are grounded in the authors’ many years in real estate education.
Inside
the cover Each chapter begins with an overview of the main section heads covered in the chapter. As
each of these heads is expanded, the subheads are displayed in the margin. Key terms are
printed in bold type the first time they are used and defined. The chapters conclude with a
study aid called the "Snapshot Review," which compresses the main points of the chapter
into one or two pages. At the end of the chapter section are tests on each chapter. The
answer key following the tests refers to the page in the text that explains the correct
answer. The book is also provided with a special section on real estate math, a practice
exam covering national and state topics reflecting the content of the state licensing
examination, and two glossaries of real estate terminology.
