During this\nevent, the buyer pays the purchase price and receives title to the purchased real\nestate. At the same time, the buyer completes financing arrangements, and buyer\nand seller pay all required taxes, fees, and charges.\nCustomary Practices. Procedures and customary practices for conducting real\nestate closings vary from state to state. For example, it is common in some states\nfor sellers to pay title insurance, while in other states the buyer and seller might\nshare this expense. Students should refer to supplemental state materials to\nascertain prevailing practices in their state.\nTime. The sale contract sets the date of the closing, usually within sixty days of\nsigning. The time period between signing and closing is expected to be sufficient\nfor the removal of any contingencies, such as the buyer's obtaining of financing,\nthe performance of inspections, and the correction of identified physical defects.\nFailure of either buyer or seller to perform pre-closing actions specified in the\ncontract can delay or terminate the transaction. If the contract includes a\nstatement that \"time is of the essence,\" all parties agree to meet the time\nlimitations exactly as stated. If both parties consent, however, they can re-\nschedule the closing date.\nLocation. Closings occur at various locations, such as the office of the title\ncompany, the lender, the escrow agent, one of the attorneys, the broker, or the\ncounty recorder. The sale contract specifies the location.\nChapter 21:Closings 329",

    "text": "Parties at closing. The primary parties at the closing are normally buyer, seller,\nand a closing agent or escrow officer. Other parties who might be present\ninclude the title officer, attorneys, brokers or agents, and the lender's\nrepresentative. It is not actually necessary for any of these parties to attend the\nmeeting. The closing agent can complete the transaction, provided all documents\nhave been duly executed in advance.\nThe closing process The closing process consists of buyer and seller verifying that each has fulfilled\nthe terms of the sale contract. If they have, then the mortgage loan, if any, is\nclosed, all expenses are apportioned and paid, the consideration is exchanged for\nthe title, final documents are signed, and arrangements are made to record the\ntransaction according to local laws.\nExhibit 21.1 The Closing Process\nConfirm performance\nClose loan\nPay expenses\nExchange funds & title\nComplete documents\nRecord transaction\nTransfer of title The seller must produce evidence of marketable title, such as a commitment for\ntitle insurance by a title insurer. Before making a title commitment, a title\ncompany performs a title search to discover any liens, encumbrances, restrictions,\nconditions, or easements attaching to the title.\nIf there are any encumbrances or liens that damage the title, the seller is expected\nto remove these prior to the date specified in the contract. The most common title\ncloud is an unpaid lien.\nThe seller may also be asked to execute an affidavit of title stating that, since the\ndate of the original title search, the seller has incurred no new liens, judgments,\nunpaid bills for repairs or improvements, no unrecorded deeds or contracts, no\nbankruptcies or divorces that would affect title, or any other defects the seller is\naware of.\n330 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The purchaser, purchaser's lender, or title company may require a survey to verify\nthe location and size of the property. The survey also identifies any easements,\nencroachments, or flood plain hazard.\nThe buyer should inspect the property to make certain that the property is in the\ncondition in which the seller states that it is, and that any repairs or other required\nactions have been performed. A final inspection, called a buyer's walk-through,\nshould be conducted as close to the closing date as possible.\nIf the seller's mortgage lien(s) are to be satisfied at closing, the lender will\nprovide a payoff statement, also called an offset statement, specifying the\namount of unpaid principal and any interest due as of the closing date, plus fees\nthat will be due the lender and any credits or penalties that may apply. The holder\nof a note secured by a trust deed will provide a similar statement, called a\nbeneficiary statement, to show any unpaid balance. Even if the buyer is\nassuming the seller's mortgage loan, the buyer will want to know the exact\namount of the unpaid balance as of the closing date.\nFinally, the seller produces and/or deposits with the escrow agent the deed that\nconveys the property to the buyer.\nTransfer of purchase\nfunds The buyer usually produces and/or deposits with the escrow agent the following:\n\uf034 earnest money\n\uf034 loan funds and documents\n\uf034 any other cash needed to complete the purchase\nEscrow procedures If the closing occurs \"in escrow\" rather than face-to-face, the principal parties\ndeposit funds and documents with the appointed escrow agent, and the escrow\nagent disburses funds and releases documents to the appropriate parties when all\nthe conditions of the escrow have been met. If for any reason the transaction\ncannot be completed, for instance if the buyer refuses the title as it is offered, or\nthe buyer fails to produce the necessary cash, the escrow instructions usually\nprovide a mechanism for reconveying title to the seller and funds to the buyer. In\nsuch a case, both parties return to their original status as if no sale had occurred.\nLender closing\nrequirements A lender is concerned about the quality of the collateral a borrower is providing\nin return for the mortgage loan. The collateral would be endangered by defects in\nthe title, by liens that would take precedence over the mortgage lien, such as a tax\nlien, and by physical damage to the property which is not repaired. Consequently,\nthe lender typically requires a survey; a property inspection; hazard insurance; a\ntitle insurance policy; a reserve account for taxes and insurance; and possibly,\nprivate mortgage insurance. In some cases the lender may also require a\ncertificate of occupancy verifying that any new construction performed complies\nwith local building codes.\nBroker's role A broker usually continues to provide service between the signing of the sale\ncontract and the closing by helping to make arrangements for pre-closing\nactivities such as inspections, surveys, appraisals and repairs and generally taking\nsteps to ensure that the closing can proceed as scheduled.\nChapter 21:Closings 331",

In many states, the broker is charged\nwith the responsibility for accuracy and timely delivery of the closing documents\nto the principal parties. A broker may also have the responsibility for reporting\nthe transaction to the Internal Revenue Service.\nFinally, if the seller of the property is a non-resident alien, U.S. law may require\nthe broker to withhold and transmit to the Internal Revenue Service a portion of\nthe sale proceeds to cover the alien seller's income tax liability.

Its purpose is to clarify settlement costs and to eliminate\nkickbacks and fees that increase settlement costs. RESPA specifies certain\nclosing procedures when a purchase:\n\uf034 involves a residential property, including one- to four-family\nresidences, cooperatives and condominiums;\n\uf034 involves a first or second mortgage lien; and\n\uf034 is being financed by a \"federally-related\" mortgage loan, which\nincludes loans made by a federally-insured lender; loans insured\nor guaranteed by the VA or FHA, loans administered by HUD,\nand loans intended to be sold to FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA.\nRESPA regulations do not apply to transactions being otherwise financed except\nin the case of an assumption in which the terms of the assumed loan are modified\nor the lender's charges for the assumption are greater than $50.\nRESPA is directed at lenders and settlement companies, but licensees should be\nfamiliar with requirements and changes implemented as of January, 2014. The\nDodd-Frank Act of 2010 granted rule-making authority under RESPA to the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and generally granted the CFPB\nauthority to supervise and enforce compliance with RESPA and its implementing\n332 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Substantive changes included modifying the servicing\ntransfer notice requirements and implementing new procedures and notice\nrequirements related to borrowers\u2019 error resolution requests and information\nrequests. The amendments also included new provisions related to escrow\npayments, force-placed insurance, general servicing policies, procedures, and\nrequirements, early intervention, continuity of contact, loss mitigation and the\nrelation of RESPA\u2019s servicing provisions to State law. These RESPA\namendments went into effect on January 10, 2014.\nTRID Effective October 3, 2015, a TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule (TRID)\nintegrates the disclosure requirements of RESPA and Truth-in-Lending, replacing\nthe old Good Faith Estimate form and HUD-1 Uniform Settlement Statement a\nnew Loan Estimate form and Closing Disclosure form, respectively.\nInformation booklet A lender subject to RESPA must give loan applicants the CFPB booklet, \"Your\nHome Loan Toolkit,\" within three days of receiving a loan application. This\nbooklet describes loans, closing costs, and the Closing Disclosure form.\nLoan Estimate A lender must give the applicant, at the time of application or within three\nbusiness days of application, a Loan Estimate (H-24) of likely settlement costs.\nThis estimate is usually based on comparable transactions completed in the area.\nThe terms stated in the Closing Disclosure must agree with those of the Loan\nEstimate within certain limits.\nMortgage servicing\ndisclosure The lender must disclose to the buyer whether the lender intends to service the loan\nor convey it to another lender for servicing. This disclosure must also be\naccompanied by information as to how the buyer can resolve complaints.\nClosing\nDisclosure Under CFPB rules, a lender must use the Closing Disclosure (H-25) to disclose\nsettlement costs to the buyer. This form covers all costs that the buyer will have\nto pay at closing, whether to the lender or to other parties. Use of this form\nenforces RESPA's prohibitions against a lender's requiring a buyer to deposit an\nexcessive amount in the tax and insurance escrow account or to use a particular\ntitle company for title insurance. The consumer must receive the completed form\nnot later than three business days before closing and has the right to inspect a\nrevised form one business day before closing. A description and example of this\nform are provided later in this chapter.\nDisclosures after\nsettlement Loan servicers must provide borrowers with an annual escrow statement which\nsummarizes all inflows and outflows in the prior 12-month period. The statement\nmust also disclose shortfalls or overages in the account, and how the\ndiscrepancies will be resolved.\nLimits on escrow\naccounts Section 10 of RESPA limits the amounts lenders can require borrowers to place\nin escrow for purposes of paying taxes, hazard insurance, and other property-\nrelated expenses. The limitation applies to the initial deposits as well as deposits\nmade over the course of the loan\u2019s term.\nReferral fees\nand kickbacks RESPA prohibits the payment of fees as part of a real estate settlement when no\nservices are actually rendered.

Disburse funds.\nSelling terms and\nclosing costs Selling terms are the price of the property, the buyer's deposit and\ndownpayment, and the terms and amounts of the buyer's financing\narrangements. Closing costs are final expenses that buyer or seller must pay at\nclosing to complete the transaction. The sale contract identifies all selling terms\nand who pays which costs. The apportionment of expenses is subject to\nnegotiation, and in the absence of a specific agreement, is determined by\ncustom. Closing costs include such items as brokerage fees, mortgage-related\nfees, title-related expenses, and real estate taxes.\nDebits and credits The closing statement accounts for the debits and credits of the buyer and seller\nto settle and complete the transaction. A debit is an amount that one party must\npay at closing or has already paid prior to closing. A credit is an amount that a\nparty must receive at closing or that has already been received prior to closing.\n334 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

To illustrate the form, we use a sample disclosure for\na 30-year fixed rate loan that is presented on the CFPB website.\nPage 1 has four sections: general information, Loan Terms, Projected Payments,\nand Costs at Closing.\nGeneral information. This section has three columns:\n\uf034 Closing information \u2013issue date, closing date, disbursement date,\nsettlement agent, file number, property address, and sale price\n\uf034 Transaction information \u2013 names and addresses for borrower, seller\nand lender\n\uf034 Loan information \u2013 loan term, loan purpose, product type, loan type\nand loan ID number\nLoan Terms.

This section displays the borrower\u2019s payment for principal\nand interest and mortgage insurance, an estimated escrow payment, and the total\nestimated monthly mortgage payment for years 1-7 and 8-30 of the loan term. It\nalso provides an estimate of monthly tax, insurance, and assessment payments\nand indicates whether the payments will be held in escrow.\nCosts at Closing. The last section of page 1 shows the borrowers' total closing\ncosts (brought forward from page 2) and the total amount of cash the buyer needs\nto close (brought forward from page 3).\nPage 2 details the closing costs.

The last line of the calculation is \"Cash to close,\" the amount the\nborrower needs to produce at closing.\nWhen an amount has changed, the creditor must indicate where the consumer can\nfind the amounts that have changed on the Loan Estimate.
