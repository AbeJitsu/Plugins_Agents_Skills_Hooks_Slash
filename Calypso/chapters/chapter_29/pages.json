Refusing or\nneglecting to follow these laws and rules is a violation punishable by temporary\nor permanent loss of license, fines, reprimands, required education coursework,\nrestitution payment, or any combination of these measures.\nThe AREC or its staff may investigate the actions of any licensee. A member of\nthe public or of the real estate profession may file a written complaint with the\nAREC about the behavior of any licensee. In either case, the Commission will\ntake steps to determine if the licensee has indeed committed a violation. These\nsteps are discussed in detail in an earlier chapter.\nThe following sections list possible violations as they are written in the license\nlaw and administrative rules.\nViolations of AREC\nrules\nAs mentioned, violating or disregarding any provision of the Alabama license\nlaw or any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission is punishable if an\ninvestigation and subsequent hearing determines the licensee is guilty.\nPleading guilty or\nnolo contendere Entering a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or a crime involving\nmoral turpitude is also a violation. This also includes being found guilty of a\nfelony or a crime of moral turpitude.\nPleading nolo contendere is not an admission of guilt. It is a plea of no contest\nwherein the individual does not accept or deny responsibility for the charges but\ndoes agree to accept punishment.\nCrimes involving moral turpitude include conduct that goes against community\nstandards of justice, honesty, or good morals. They have a level of vileness or\n496 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

A crime involving moral turpitude often brings more severe criminal\ncharges or penalties.\nFinal money\njudgment Any act or omission that occurs while the licensee is pursuing his or her real\nestate business or that involves the goodwill of an existing real estate business\nand that results in the licensee having a final money judgment rendered against\nhim or her is also a violation.\nFor example, a buyer could potentially sue a licensee because the licensee did not\nmake all required disclosures. In such a suit, the buyer may be granted a final\nmoney judgment to cover any damages the buyer suffered due to the lack of\ndisclosure. In this case, the licensee would have violated the law by omitting the\ndisclosures and, consequently, having a judgment against him or her.\nNot fulfilling\nobligations to\ntransaction parties The license law outlines specific obligations licensees have to real estate\nconsumers, whether customers or clients, as covered in a previous chapter.\nFailure to meet these obligations is a violation of the law.\nAn example of such a violation would be failing to keep confidential information\nconfidential or failing to present purchase offers as received by the licensee. A\nviolation would also occur with failing to disclose material facts regarding the\nproperty or transaction.\nFailure to report\nlegal action\ndisposition If a licensee has action taken against him or her in a criminal or civil matter\ninvolving a real estate transaction, the licensee must notify the Commission\nwithin 10 days after receiving notice of the action. Notice to the Commission\nmust be in writing and sent certified mail. The notice should also include a copy\nof the summons and complaint. In the case of a criminal charge, the notice must\ninclude the specific charge and a copy of any indictment or information alleging\nthe charges. Failure to notify the Commission in this manner and this time frame\nis a violation.\nFor example, if a client has filed a suit against the licensee for misrepresentation\nor failure to disclose, the licensee must let the Commission know about the suit\nwithin 10 days of receiving notice of the suit.\nChapter 29: Alabama License Law Violations 497",

Under Alabama license law, the first obligation that licensees have to all\nconsumers is to provide services honestly and in good faith.\nAny of the following acts which defy the obligation of honesty and good faith is\na violation of the law.\nDishonesty in\nprocuring license The license law stipulates requirements for obtaining a real estate license. If a\nlicensee or applicant uses fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit or makes a material\nmisstatement of fact to obtain or attempt to obtain a license, he or she has\nviolated the law. Such is the case whether the license is for him or herself or for\nanother person.\nThis offense would include such actions as cheating on the licensure\nexamination, making false statements on the application, using the licensee's\nname to obtain a license for someone else, and so on.\nDishonesty in\npersonal real\nestate transactions Licensees are required to be honest and forthright when selling, buying, trading,\nor renting real property belonging to the licensee or to his or her spouse, child, or\nparent. If the licensee is dishonest or commits fraud or misrepresentation in this\nsituation, he or she has violated the law.\nLet's say that licensee Lenny is representing a buyer who is interested in a home\nthat Lenny just happens to own. However, Lenny doesn't disclose his ownership\nof the home. Lenny also does not disclose that the home was flooded a year ago,\nresulting in the occurrence of black mold in the basement that was not\nprofessionally removed. When the buyer makes an offer on the home, Lenny tells\nthe buyer that the owner has multiple offers and encourages the buyer to\ndrastically increase his offer price.\nLenny has violated the law by failing to disclose his interest in the property, by\nfailing to disclose material facts about the property that will put the buyer's health\n498 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The licensee must know\nabout the defect(s), and the defects must not be trivial or insignificant. The\ndefects must qualify as significant factors in the buyer deciding whether or not to\npurchase or lease the property.\nIf we look again at licensee Lenny who is selling his own home and not\ndisclosing his ownership interest or the previous mold issue, we might also\ndiscover that the home has structural issues from the flooding and length of time\nthe flood water sat in the home. Of course, Lenny doesn't disclose this structural\nissue either. Consequently, Lenny has committed yet another violation of the law\nby not disclosing a latent structural defect that, if the buyer knew about, could\npotentially cause the buyer to walk away from the purchase.\nFalse promises to\ninfluence or\ninduce Considering that the law requires licensees to be honest in real estate\ntransactions, making false promises to influence, persuade, or induce a person to\nsign a contract or agreement is dishonest and a violation of the law.\nFor example, Lenny's home is next door to a rather run down home with an\nunkempt yard, and the buyer is reluctant to purchase based on the neighboring\nproperty. Lenny is untruthful in telling the buyer that the neighboring property\nhas just been purchased and the new owners will be renovating the home and\ncleaning up the yard. Lenny promises the buyer that the house next door will be\nbeautiful within a few months. Reality is that the current neighbors have no\nintention of selling the home or cleaning up the property.\nFurthermore, to influence the buyer to sign the purchase agreement, Lenny\npromises the buyer that once the neighbor's property is cleaned up and renovated,\nthe value of the home Lenny is selling will increase by at least 25%, resulting in\nthe buyer ending up with considerable equity in the home. If the buyer should\nresell the home, he or she would obtain a much higher asking price than what the\nbuyer will pay.\nLenny has made multiple false promises to influence the buyer to sign a purchase\nagreement. Lenny has violated the law.\nMisrepresentation\nthrough other\nagents Just as licensees are not allowed to make false promises to influence a person to\nsign a contract, the licensee is also not allowed to continue the false promises or\nmisrepresentations through other agents or salespersons. The licensee also may\nnot continue the deception through any form of advertising.\nOnce again using Lenny as an example, if he uses another agent to further\ninfluence the buyer to purchase the home based on Lenny's false promises and\nmisrepresentation, Lenny has violated this particular section of the law.

    "text": "advertises the home for sale with any of these misrepresentations or false\npromises, that is also a violation of this law.\nDeceitful\nadvertising Actually, the law specifically prohibits deceptive advertising. Licensees must not\npublish or cause to be published any advertisement that deceives the public, even\nif it is only likely to deceive. Advertisements must not create a misleading\nimpression.\nFor example, let's say a licensee publishes the following advertisement:\nBeautiful 4-bedroom home in up and coming neighborhood with child-\nfriendly park and waterfront homes. For more details, call Harold\nConnor at 555-8382.\nIn reality, the home has 3 bedrooms and a garage that is enclosed and is currently\nbeing used as a fourth bedroom although it does not contain any closets. The\n\"child-friendly\" park is really a vacant lot at the end of the street, and the\n\"waterfront\" homes sit adjacent to a fenced retention pond.\nThe ad for this home is deceptive and certainly gives a misleading impression of\nthe home. Consequently, the ad and the licensee are in violation of the law.\nInducing a party\nto breach a contract Typically, parties to a transaction sign a contract with terms to which all of the\nparties have agreed. Neither party may breach the contract without consequences.\nAt the same time, the licensee must not convince either party to breach the\ncontract and substitute a new one that will benefit the licensee more than the\noriginal contract.\nLicensee Linda represents a seller who has already signed a purchase agreement\nwith a buyer. The contract states the amount of the purchase price at $250,000.\nBoth seller and buyer have agreed to that price. However, Linda knows that a\nhigher purchase price will bring her a higher commission payment. If Linda\nconvinces the seller to breach the contract and substitute a new contract with an\nincreased selling price, Linda has violated this law.\nAnother example would be if Licensee Linda changes qualifying brokers and\ntries to take this client's listing with her to the new brokerage firm. The listing\nagreement is with the original firm and cannot be moved to the new firm unless\nthe client breaches the contract with the original brokerage firm. If Linda\nconvinces the client to cancel the original contract and sign another one at the\nnew firm, she is violating this law.\nDishonest dealings,\nbad faith,\nuntrustworthiness Remember that Alabama real estate laws and rules emphasize honesty and good\nfaith. Trustworthiness is not just a good quality, it is a requirement. Therefore,\nanything that a real estate professional does that constitutes dishonest dealings,\nbad faith, or untrustworthiness is a violation of the Alabama License Law.\nMany examples can be cited: if a client tells his or her agent something in\nconfidence, trusting the agent to keep the confidence, the agent must exercise\ntrustworthiness by keeping the confidence. If the licensee receives offers to\npurchase a client's property, the agent must exercise good faith by delivering the\n500 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Licensees must continually\ndemonstrate that they can be trusted. If they fail to demonstrate that or fail to be\nhonest and trustworthy, they have violated the law that requires this of them.\nUnlicensed person\nacting on behalf of\nlicensee The law is specific on what acts require a real estate salesperson or broker\nlicense. Remember that the law requires a real estate license for anyone who\nsells, buys, leases, rents, exchanges real property or negotiates to sell, buy, lease,\nrent, or exchange real property for another person for compensation. An\nunlicensed person who performs any of those acts for compensation is breaking\nthe law.\nThe law also stipulates that, if anyone helps, employs, or establishes an\nassociation with an unlicensed person and expects or requires the unlicensed\nperson to perform any of those acts, that individual is also breaking the law.\nSo, if a qualifying broker hires an unlicensed individual for the purpose of listing\nand showing properties, the qualifying broker is violating this law.\nFurthermore, an individual is also prohibited from aiding, abetting, or conspiring\nwith a person to circumvent the licensing requirements outlined in the license\nlaws.\nFor example, Joe wants to work as a real estate broker, but he does not have a\nlicense. Joe doesn't meet the qualifications for licensure because he never\ngraduated from high school or obtained a GED. Sarah falsifies a high school\ndiploma and graduation records for Joe so he can qualify for licensure. Not only\nhas Joe violated the law, but so has Sarah.\nFailure to disclose\nintention to\npurchase If a licensee is interested in purchasing the property his or her seller client is\nselling, the licensee must disclose the interest to the client. If the agent selling the\nproperty is the licensee's associate, the licensee still must disclose his or her\ninterest in purchasing the property. Whether the licensee plans to buy the\nproperty directly or indirectly, the licensee still must disclose his or her interest.\nThis mandate is similar to the one that requires a licensee to disclose his or her\nown interest in a property the licensee is selling. Both situations require the\nlicensee to let the client know about the licensee's interest in the property.\nIf Tami has a client who is selling a home that Tami would like to buy, Tami\nmust tell the client that she will be the purchaser. However, let's say that Tami\nwants to buy the home but doesn't want to disclose that to the seller. So, Tami\ndecides to have her father purchase the home and then transfer the title over to\nTami. In this way, Tami would be purchasing the home indirectly, but, under\nAlabama law, she would still be required to disclose this to the seller. Failure to\ndo so is a violation of the law.\nFailure to disclose\nthe true terms of\na contract Licensees must disclose the true terms of a real estate sale to any lender,\nguaranteeing agency, or any other interested party.

    "text": "licensees must not misrepresent the terms of the sale to any of these agencies or\ninterested parties.\nFor example, lenders give mortgage loans based on the value of the property. If\nthe value of a property is misrepresented to the lender at $250,000 when the\nvalue is really $200,000, the loan to value ratio will be incorrect. The lender will\nmost likely set up a mortgage loan at a higher amount than the property supports.\nThe licensee who misrepresented the property's true value will have violated this\nparticular law.\nKeeping in mind many of the other mandates of the law, the licensee will also\nhave violated mandated honesty, trustworthiness, and good faith.\nActing negligently\nor incompetently To qualify for a license, Alabama law requires a person to be trustworthy and\ncompetent to practice real estate. The law also sets forth the acts for which an\nindividual must possess a real estate license. The law further mandates that an\nindividual must not act negligently or incompetently in performing any of those\nacts which require a license.\nSo, let's use Jim as an example. Jim holds a real estate broker license and is in the\nprocess of handling a transaction for a client purchasing a home. Jim knows he\nhas certain obligations to the client, such as looking out for the client's best\ninterest and negotiating the best purchase price for the home. However, Jim has\nbeen rather distracted lately and has not been fulfilling his obligations. Jim\nneglected to suggest his client have the home inspected. He also neglected to\npoint out to the client that the home is in a deed restricted community. Further,\nJim didn't appear to know how to negotiate the best price. When the seller\ncounter offered at a higher price, Jim recommended that his client offer an even\nhigher price than the counteroffer, just to\" seal the deal.\"\nThe buyer was confused by Jim's recommendation but figured Jim, as a\nprofessional, knew what he was doing. Unfortunately, the client was wrong. Jim\nwas negligent and acting incompetently during most of the transaction, costing\nthe client thousands of dollars. By doing so, Jim violated the law that says he\nmust not act negligently or incompetently when practicing the business of real\nestate.\n502 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The\nlaw states that licensees must account for all money he or she receives which\nbelongs to someone else and what the licensee must do with that money.\nTherefore, a licensee is violating the law if he or she fails to account for money\nbelonging to others which the licensee has received.\nLicensee Julie received earnest money on a pending property sale. Let's take a\nlook at what Julie did with the money.\nJulie received the earnest money in cash on Monday. She decided to hang onto\nthe money for a while to see if the sale would actually go through. Although she\nmentioned receiving the money to her qualifying broker, she did not turn the\nfunds over to him. Julie's qualifying broker knew she had the earnest money but\nhad no idea the amount of the funds. Julie herself had not recorded the amount,\ndate, client, or actual receipt of the funds.\nAs it turned out, the sale went through, and the transaction closed. However, Julie\nhad violated the law by not accounting for the funds and by not turning the funds\nover to her qualifying broker for deposit,\nCommingling The law also makes it clear that commingling, or mixing others' money with the\nlicensee's personal or business funds is not allowed.\nSo, if we go back to the case of Julie and the earnest money she received, let's see\nwhat she actually did with the money while she was hanging onto it.\nAfter Julie received the cash and mentioned it to her qualifying broker, she\ndecided she wouldn't have the funds deposited into the company's trust account\nso she could readily access the money if necessary. Instead, she decided she\nChapter 29: Alabama License Law Violations 503",

Three weeks later, Julie deposited the cash into her account, and she\ndidn't think about it again until the transaction was in its final stages.\nWhile the money may or may not have been safe in Julie's personal account, it\ndidn't belong there. The law states any funds belonging to others must be turned\nover to the qualifying broker and must be deposited into a trust account. Funds\nbelonging to others must not be commingled with funds belonging to the licensee\nor the company. Julie violated that law.\nFailure to keep\nfunds in separate,\nfederally insured\naccount Federally insured accounts protect any funds deposited into the account. Deposits\nare insured for $250,000. Because of this security, Alabama license law requires\nlicensees to have any money belonging to others deposited into a separate\nfederally insured account in a financial institution located in Alabama.\nBack to Julie: Most likely her personal checking account was at a federally\ninsured bank, so the funds were secure once they were deposited. However, we\nalready know she broke the law by depositing the cash into her own account and\nnot recording or accounting for the funds at all. What we might not have known\nis that Julie's personal account is with a bank located across the state line in\nGeorgia. Additionally, Julie hung onto the cash for 3 weeks before she deposited\nit.\nDuring the 3 weeks she was hanging onto the cash, Julie was committing another\nviolation by not having the funds secured in a federally insured account. Once\nJulie deposited the funds into her own account, she was still violating this\nparticular mandate because, not only were the funds commingled with Julie's\npersonal funds, but the money was deposited in a bank located outside of\nAlabama.\nFailure to keep\nrecords for 3 years According to license law, if a document is touched or created by a licensee\nduring any real estate activities, the qualifying broker must be given a copy of the\ndocument to be kept in his or her files. Documents which must be kept include all\ncontracts, leases, listings, and other records, including a complete record of all\nfunds that belong to others, showing to whom the money belongs, the date any\nmonies were deposited and/or withdrawn, and any other pertinent information.\nAll documents and records must be kept for at least 3 years. Failing to do so is a\nviolation of the law.\nThis mandate could be broken in multiple ways: first, the licensee could fail to\ngive copies of documents to the qualifying broker as required by law. Second, the\nqualifying broker could fail to keep the records for at least 3 years as required.\nOne more way a violation could occur is if the records of funds belonging to\nothers do not include names and dates as required.\n504 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Paying commission\nto unlicensed\nperson Because the law requires anyone performing specific acts in a real estate\ntransaction to be licensed if the individual is compensated for the acts, then an\nunlicensed person may not be paid any profit, compensation, commission, or fee\nfor performing such acts. These acts include but are not limited to selling, buying,\nleasing, renting, and exchanging real property or negotiating to sell, buy, lease,\nrent, or exchange real property.\nHowever, the law specifically does not prohibit a licensee from owning a\nbusiness organization whose purpose is to receive payments of profits,\ncompensation, commissions, or fees. In this case, the business does not need to\nhold a real estate license as long as it does not engage in any other activity that\nrequires a license.\nSo, let's say that Jerrod is a licensed real estate broker. His friend Frank helps him\nfrom time to time in certain real estate transactions. Frank is not licensed, so\nJerrod is careful about what he allows Frank to do. However, Jerrod is not as\ncareful as he should be. He allows Frank to show property and, in return, pays\nFrank a percentage of any commission received when the property sells.\nJerrod has violated two laws: he is allowing an unlicensed person to perform acts\nthat require a license, and he is compensating an unlicensed person for\nperforming acts that require a license.\nNow let's say that Jerrod owns a business that collects any funds owed in relation\nto real estate transactions. The business collects commissions, profits, and other\ncompensation and fees. That is all they do. However, the business is not licensed\nunder Alabama real estate license laws. Has Jerrod violated another law?\nNo, Jerrod has not violated another law. Jerrod is allowed to own such an\nunlicensed business as long as the business does not perform any acts that require\na real estate license.\nUndisclosed or\npost-closing rebates Alabama law prohibits paying or receiving a rebate from any person in a real\nestate transaction after the transaction has closed. By Commission definition, a\nrebate is any unearned fee, kickback, or thing of value that is given in connection\nwith a real estate transaction. Further, the definition of a rebate implies it is\nsomething given back after a transaction has occurred.\nGiving any rebate or incentive legally depends mostly on how and when it is\ngiven. In Alabama, the incentive must be given before or at closing and must be\ndisclosed to all parties involved in the transaction, to include the seller, buyer,\nand lender or guaranteeing agency (FHA, VA, HUD). A rebate or other incentive\nthat is given after or outside of the closing and is related to the transaction\nviolates the law. Since rebates given before or during closing must be disclosed,\nan undisclosed rebate related to the transaction also violates the law.\nIf the incentive is not disclosed to the lender, etc., the law that prohibits\nmisrepresentation or failure to disclose the true terms of a sale to the lender,\nguaranteeing agency, or other interested parties will have been violated.

If that\nloan or gift is not disclosed, not only has the licensee violated the law, but he or\nshe may also have criminal charges brought against him or her.\nLottery inducements Offering free lots or conducting lotteries to influence a party to purchase or lease\nreal estate is a violation of the license law. This practice also violates other laws.\nIf a licensee offers free lots as incentive to purchase or lease real estate, the\nlicensee must disclose the gift and its value, just as with rebates. Further, the\ntransfer of ownership of the lots would need to take place prior to or at closing of\nthe purchase or lease transaction, or the licensee has violated the law prohibiting\nrebates.\nIn regard to offering lotteries, Alabama has criminal statutes prohibiting lotteries\nof any kind. Therefore, licensees offering lotteries as incentives to purchase or\nlease real estate would be violating these statutes and would most likely be\nbrought up on criminal charges.\nAccepting\ncommission from\nanyone other than\nqualifying broker Salespersons and associate brokers may accept commission payments or any\nother compensation only from their qualifying broker. Therefore, if a salesperson\nor associate broker engages in activities that require a license and then accepts\nany form of compensation directly from a seller, a company, or anyone else other\nthan the qualifying broker, that salesperson or associate broker has violated the\nlaw.\nFor example, Betsy is Tim's agent handling the sale of his family home. Betsy\nhas done a great job of showing the home and finding just the right buyer. So,\nTim is grateful to Betsy for making the experience pleasant.

In the end, 3\nmonths passed with Jason still not providing the information to the Commission.\nBy definition, reasonable time is the amount of time that is fairly necessary to do\nwhat is requested or required as soon as circumstances permit. Although the\nlicense law provides a reasonable time and not a specific time period for the\nbroker to produce the information, the AREC most likely will not consider 3\nmonths with still no information provided as reasonable. Jason is violating the\nlaw by not providing the information within a reasonable time and certainly by\nnot providing it at all.\nFailure to return\nrecords During a real estate transaction, the licensee may find it necessary to obtain\ncertain documents or records from a client or other party to the transaction. If the\nparty provides the document and later wants the document returned, the licensee\nmust return the document to its rightful owner. Failure to do so is a violation of\nthe law unless the licensee has a legal cause for not returning the document.\nDuring a transaction to purchase a home in a deed restricted community, Sue was\nasked to give her agent a copy of her dog's shot records and license registration.\nSue complied because she understood the community's rule that all pets must be\nkept up to date on their shots and licensing. Once the transaction closed and Sue\nwas moving into the new home, she told her agent she wanted her dog's records\nreturned to her. Her agent, however, stated he wanted to keep the records in his\nfile on the entire transaction and would not return them to Sue.\nNot having legal cause to keep the dog's records, Sue's agent violated the law by\nnot returning the records to their rightful owner.\nFailure to report\naddress change When a licensee is issued a license certificate, the certificate includes the address\nof his place of business. If the licensee changes that address, he or she must\nnotify the Commission in writing within 30 days after the address changes. The\nlicensee needs to include both the company's old address and the new address in\nthe written notification. To change the business address, the qualifying broker\nmust return the company license and all broker and salesperson licenses to the\nCommission with a transfer fee for each license. Failure to notify the AREC\nwithin the 30 days, to include the required information, and/or to return the\ncompany and other licenses violates the administrative rules of the AREC.\nFor example, Kelly owns a real estate firm on Main Street with 3 associate\nbrokers and 4 salespersons. Kelly is the qualifying broker for the firm. Kelly\nrecently found a new location over on Elm Street and has moved the entire office\noperations to the new location. She's been so busy with the move and getting all\nof her salespersons and brokers settled that she has not notified the Commission\nof her new address, nor has she returned all of the current licenses as required. It's\nbeen 3 weeks since she moved, so Kelly still has time to notify the Commission\n508 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

When licensees\ndo not fulfill those obligations, they are in violation of Alabama license law and\nthe AREC Administrative Rules.\nUnauthorized\ndual agency Licensees may enter into a few types of agency with consumers. One of those is\ndual agency. The most important aspect of this relationship is that all parties to\nthe relationship must consent to their agent representing more than one party in\nthe same transaction. When the parties consent to this arrangement, they must do\nso in writing. If the licensee does not obtain the authorization of all parties, the\nlicensee has violated the law.\nLet's say that licensee Scott is in a position to represent both seller Raymond and\nbuyer Denise in the sale of Raymond's home and five acres of land. Both\nRaymond and Denise want Scott to represent them, but they are not familiar with\ndual agency relationships. Raymond is trying to figure out how to have Scott\nrepresent just him and let Denise find her own agent. The situation is becoming\ntense.\nScott explains to Raymond that he can legally represent both him and Denise in\nthe transaction under the dual agency relationship. Raymond agrees to the\narrangement, and the transaction progresses. There is just one problem: Scott\nnever informed Denise or obtained her authorization for the dual agency\nrelationship. Because the law states that Scott must obtain written consent from\nall parties he is representing, getting only Raymond's consent was not enough.\nScott has violated the law.\nFailure to provide\ndocument copies When a party is involved in a real estate transaction, that party has the right to\nreceive copies of each document related to the transaction. It is the licensee's\nobligation to furnish the copies, so failure to do so violates the law.\nGeorge is selling his property and has signed an agency agreement with Eddie, a\nbroker representing Home Hunters Realtors. Eddie and George have set forth the\nterms of the agreement and the listing for the property. After Eddie has shown the\nproperty several times without receiving any offers, George wants to take another\nlook at the agreement and listing contract. He asks Eddie for copies of the\nChapter 29: Alabama License Law Violations 509",

Not only has Eddie lied to his client, but he has broken the law that\nsays he must voluntarily furnish a copy of each listing, contract, lease, and other\ndocument to each party executing the document. He must do so with reasonable\npromptness.\nAdvertising without\nprominently\ndisplaying\nbrokerage name Advertising real estate in Alabama brings with it certain requirements under the\nlaw. One requirement is that the advertiser must identify him or herself as a\nlicensed real estate salesperson or broker. Another requirement is that the\nsalesperson or broker must include the name or trade name of the qualifying\nbroker or company prominently on all advertising. Likewise, the qualifying\nbroker must not allow the salesperson or broker to advertise without including the\nname or trade name of the company or qualifying broker prominently on all\nadvertising.\n\u201cProminently\u201d means the information must be printed in a larger font than is used\nelsewhere in the ad for terms such as \u201cfor sale\u201d or \u201cfor lease,\u201d and the\ninformation must be placed where it will get the attention of consumers who are\nlooking at the ad.\nTania puts together the following ad for a property she is contracted to sell:\nNewly remodeled 3-bedroom condominium for sale. Small\nhomeowner association fee and nice amenities, including an indoor\npool and gym. Covered parking with security. Contact Tania Riley,\na licensed real estate broker, at 555-8855 for details.\nTania knows she must identify herself as a licensed broker within the ad, and she\nshows the ad to her qualifying broker to assure she has done everything\naccording to the law. Her qualifying broker agrees that everything looks good\nand approves the ad for placement in the local newspaper and online.\nOnce the ad is placed, both Tania and her qualifying broker will have violated the\nlaw requiring the name or trade name of the company and qualifying broker to be\nincluded in all advertising. By allowing the ad to be placed without the company\nname showing prominently, the qualifying broker has also violated the law.\nPlacing a sign on\nproperty without\nowner's consent When a licensee signs a listing agreement with a client, one of the first things the\nagent will want to do is advertise the property for sale. Placing a sign on the\nproperty is one effective advertising technique. However, according to the law,\nthe licensee must obtain the client's consent before placing any signs on the\nproperty. Failure to do so violates the law.\nLee has just signed a listing agreement with Terrance, so Lee is anxious to get the\nproperty advertised and sold. While Lee is touring the home and taking\nphotographs, he places a for sale sign in the front yard. The sign meets all\nadvertising requirements by including the firm's name and Lee's license\ndesignation, so Lee thinks he has done everything right. However, although Lee\nasked for consent to photograph the home and advertise it for sale, he never\n510 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

So, Lee has violated the law\nthat says he must obtain the consent of the property owner before placing a for\nsale sign on the property.\nTaking a net listing A net listing is one that stipulates a net price the owner must receive for the sale\nof the property with any amount received over that net price going to the broker\nas his or her commission. The commission is not based on a percent of the sale\nprice but is actually the amount in excess of the owner's required net price. Net\nlistings are not permitted in many states, including Alabama. Therefore, any\nlicensee accepting a net listing agreement for the sale of real property or any\ninterest in the property is in violation of the law.\nFor example, Caroline has a new client who wants to sell his home. The client\nwants $350,000 for the home, not a penny more or less. Caroline thinks the home\nis worth considerably more than $350,000, so she suggests they set up the\ncommission to be paid as any amount for which she can sell the home in excess\nof the $350,000. As long as the client gets his $350,000, he doesn't care how\nmuch she gets for the house, so he agrees to let Caroline's commission be\nwhatever amount over $350,000 she receives for the house. Both the client and\nCaroline are happy with the arrangement.\nHowever, what Caroline has done is set up a net listing. In doing so, she has\nviolated the law that prohibits net listings in Alabama.\nOmission of\nexpiration date on\nlisting\nThe listing agreement creates an agency and fiduciary relationship between the\nseller and the licensee. Most states require the listing agreement to be in writing\nand to include an expiration date. The AREC Administrative Rules do not allow\nautomatic extensions of a listing agreement, so the expiration date must be\nincluded. Failing to include a fixed expiration date in the listing agreement is a\nviolation. Further, the law requires a copy of the listing agreement to be given to\nthe principal (seller).\nBrian signed a listing agreement with Sheri. Brian included an expiration date for\nthe agreement but told Sheri that the date was flexible. In case the property was\nnot sold by the stated expiration date, they would just set up an automatic\nextension of the expiration date so the listing agreement would remain in effect\nuntil the property was actually sold. That sounded okay to Sheri until she learned\nthat setting a flexible expiration date and/or automatically extending the\nexpiration date was against Alabama law. Sheri then declined to sign the listing\nagreement and found another broker who did not violate the law or rules.\nFailure to present\nall offers When a licensee signs a listing agreement with a seller, one of the main\nobligations the licensee has to the seller client is to present all written purchase\noffers to the client. Failure to do so is a violation.\nIra has a listing agreement with Frank to sell Frank's farm. Ira has received only\none offer on the property. He knows he's supposed to show the offer to Frank, but\nIra thinks the offer is just too low. So, Ira decides to decline the offer without\nshowing it to Frank and to wait for a better offer to come in.\nChapter 29: Alabama License Law Violations 511",
