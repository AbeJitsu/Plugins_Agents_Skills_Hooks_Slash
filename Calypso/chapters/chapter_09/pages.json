Such informal descriptions are not acceptable for use in public\nrecordation or, generally speaking, in a court of law because they lack both\npermanence and sufficient information for a surveyor to locate the property.\nEven if a legal document or public record refers to an address, the\nreference is always supported by an accepted legal description.\nA legal description of real property is one which accurately locates and\nidentifies the boundaries of the subject parcel to a degree acceptable by courts\nof law in the state where the property is located.\nThe general criterion for a legal description is that it alone provides sufficient\ndata for a surveyor to locate the parcel. A legal description identifies the\nproperty as unique and distinct from all other properties.\nLegal description provides accuracy and consistency over time. Systems of\nlegal description, in theory, facilitate transfers of ownership and prevent\nboundary disputes and problems with chain of title.\nA legal description is required for:\n\uf034 public recording\n\uf034 creating a valid deed of conveyance or lease\n\uf034 completing mortgage documents\n\uf034 executing and recording other legal documents\nIn addition, a legal description provides a basis for court rulings on\nencroachments and easements.\n120 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The three accepted methods of legally describing parcels of real estate are:\n\uf034 metes and bounds\n\uf034 rectangular survey system, or government survey method\n\uf034 recorded plat method, or lot and block method\nSince the metes and bounds method preceded the inception of the rectangular\nsurvey system, the older East Coast states generally employ metes and bounds\ndescriptions. States in the Midwest and West predominantly use the rectangular\nsurvey system. Some states combine methods.\nMETES AND BOUNDS\nA metes and bounds description identifies the boundaries of a parcel of real estate\nusing reference points, distances, and angles. The description always identifies an\nenclosed area by starting at an origination point, called point of beginning, or\nPOB, and returning to the POB at the end of the description. A metes and bounds\ndescription must return to the POB in order to be valid.\nThe term \"metes\" refers to distance and direction, and the term \"bounds\"\nrefers to fixed reference points, or monuments and landmarks, which may\nbe natural and artificial. Natural landmarks include trees, rocks, rivers, and\nlakes. Artificial landmarks are typically surveyor stakes.\nMany states use metes and bounds description to describe properties within\nthe rectangular survey system.\nA metes and bounds description begins with an identification of the city, county,\nand state where the property is located. Next, it identifies the POB and describes\nthe distance and direction from the POB to the first monument, and then to\nsubsequent monuments that define the property's enclosed perimeter.\nChapter 9: Legal Descriptions 121",

    "text": "THE RECTANGULAR SURVEY SYSTEM\nThe survey grid\nSections of township\nFractions of a section\nConverting section fractions to acres\nThe federal government developed the rectangular survey system, or\ngovernment survey method, to simplify and standardize property descriptions\nas a replacement for the cumbersome and often inaccurate metes and bounds\nmethod. The system was further modified to facilitate the transfer of large\nquantities of government-owned western lands to private parties.\nTo institute the system, all affected land was surveyed using latitude (east-west)\nand longitude (north-south) lines. The object was to create uniform grids of\nsquares, called townships, which would have equal size and be given a numerical\nreference for identification.\nExhibit 9.2 Principal Meridians and Base Parallels\nThe rectangular survey system works well for describing properties that are\nsquare or rectangular in shape, since these can be described as fractions of\nsections. However, for an irregular shape, such as a triangle, the rectangular\nsystem is inadequate as a method of legal description. The full description has to\ninclude a metes and bounds or lot and block description.\nChapter 9: Legal Descriptions 123",

The north-south, longitudinal lines on the survey grid are\nmeridians. The principal meridian is the single designated meridian for\nidentifying townships in the principal meridian's geographical \"jurisdiction.\"\nThere are 37 principal meridians in the national survey. In the exhibit, the\nprincipal meridian is the Tallahassee Principal Meridian.\nParallel. The east-west, latitudinal lines are called parallels. The base parallel\nor base line is the designated line for identifying townships. There is a base\nparallel for each principal meridian\nRange. The north-south area between consecutive meridians is called a range.\nThe area labeled \"B\" in the exhibit is a range. A range is identified by its\nrelationship to the principal meridian. All ranges are six miles wide.\nTier. The east-west area between two parallels is called a tier, or a township\nstrip. The area marked \"C\" in the exhibit is a tier. A tier is identified by its\nrelationship to the base parallel. All tiers are six miles wide.\nTownship. A township is the area enclosed by the intersection of two\nconsecutive meridians and two consecutive parallels, as the shaded square\nmarked \"A\" in the exhibit illustrates. Since the parallels and meridians are six\nmiles apart, a township is a square with six miles on each side. Its area is\ntherefore 36 square miles.\nSections of\na township The rectangular survey system divides a township into thirty-six squares called\nsections. Each side of a section is one mile in length. Thus the area of a section\nis one square mile, or 640 acres. As the next exhibit illustrates, the sections in a\ntownship are numbered sequentially starting with Section 1 in the northeast\ncorner, proceeding east to west across the top row, continuing from west to east\n124 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Thus, its acreage is\none quarter of 640, or 160 acres. Going further, the E 1/2 of the SW 1/4 is one\nhalf of that one quarter, or 80 acres. The E 1/2 of the SW 1/4 of the SW \u00bc is 20\nacres.\nA quick method of calculating the acreage of a parcel from its legal description is\nas follows:\n(1) Multiply the denominators of the fractional descriptions together.\n(2) Divide 640 by the resulting number.\nApplying this method to the foregoing descriptions, we get:\n640\nSW 1/4 of a section: =160 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\n4\n640\nE 1/2 of the SW 1/4 of a section: =80 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\n(2\ud835\udc654)\n640\nE 1/2 of the SW 1/4 of the SW 1/4 of a section =20 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\n(2\ud835\udc654\ud835\udc654)\n:\nRECORDED PLAT METHOD\nSubdivision plat map\nDescription format\nSubdivision plat map The recorded plat method, also called the lot and block system, is used to\ndescribe properties in residential, commercial, and industrial subdivisions.\nUnder this system, tracts of land are subdivided into lots. The entire group of\nlots comprises the subdivision. In a large subdivision, lots may be grouped\ntogether into blocks for ease of reference. The entire subdivision is surveyed to\nspecify the size and location of each lot and block. The surveyor then\nincorporates the survey data into a plat of survey, or subdivision plat map,\nwhich must comply with local surveying standards and ordinances.\nIf local authorities accept it, the subdivision plat map is recorded in the county\nwhere the subdivision is located. The recorded lot and block numbers of a\nsubdivision parcel, along with its section, township and meridian reference,\nbecome the property's legal description. The exhibit shows a sample subdivision\nplat map.\n126 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The original datum was defined by the U.S. Geological\nSurvey as mean sea level at New York harbor. A surveyor uses a datum as an\nofficial elevation point to describe the height or depth of a property. If, for\nexample, the datum for an area is a point 100 feet above sea level, all surveys in\nChapter 9: Legal Descriptions 127",

To simplify matters, surveyors have identified local\nelevation markers, called benchmarks, to provide reference elevations for\nnearby properties.
