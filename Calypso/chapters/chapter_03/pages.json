An undivided interest is an owner's interest in a property in\nwhich two or more parties share ownership. The terms \"undivided\" and\n\"indivisible\" signify that the owner's interest is in a fractional part of the entire\nestate, not in a physical portion of the real property itself. If two co-owners have\nan undivided equal interest, one owner may not lay claim to the northern half of\nthe property for his or her exclusive use.\nExamples of interests include:\n\uf034 an owner who enjoys the complete bundle of rights\n\uf034 a tenant who temporarily enjoys the right to use and exclude\n\uf034 a lender who enjoys the right to encumber the property over the\nlife of a mortgage loan\n\uf034 a repairman who encumbers the property when the owner fails to\npay for services\n\uf034 a buyer who prevents an owner from selling the property to\nanother party under the terms of the sale contract\n\uf034 a mining company which temporarily owns the right to\nextract minerals from the property's subsurface\n\uf034 a local municipality which has the right to control how an owner\nuses the property\n\uf034 a utility company which claims access to the property in\naccordance with an easement\nChapter 3: Interests and Estates 29",

If the\ninterest-holder enjoys the right of possession, the party is considered to have an\nestate in land, or, familiarly an estate. If a private interest-holder does not have\nthe right to possess, the interest is an encumbrance. If the interest-holder is not\nprivate, such as a government entity, and does not have the right to possess, the\ninterest is some form of public interest.\nAn encumbrance enables a non-owning party to restrict the owner's bundle of\nrights. Tax liens, mortgages, easements, and encroachments are examples.\nPublic entities may own or lease real estate, in which case they enjoy an estate in\nland. However, government entities also have non-possessory interests in real\nestate which act to control land use for the public good within the entity's\njurisdiction. The prime example of public interest is police power, or the right of\nthe local or county government to zone. Another example of public interest is the\nright to acquire ownership through the power of eminent domain.\nEstates in land An estate in land is an interest that includes the right of possession. Depending\non the length of time one may enjoy the right to possess the estate, the\nrelationships of the parties owning the estate, and specific interests held in the\nestate, an estate is a freehold or a leasehold estate.\n30 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The owner of\nthe freehold estate is the freehold tenant, and the renter, or lessee, is the\nleasehold tenant.\nFREEHOLD ESTATES\nFee simple estate\nLife estate\nConventional life estate\nLegal life estate\nFreehold estates differ primarily according to the duration of the estate and what\nhappens to the estate when the owner dies.

It includes the complete bundle of rights, and the tenancy is\nunlimited, with certain exceptions indicated below. The fee simple interest is also\ncalled the \"fee interest,\" or simply, the \"fee.\" The owner of the fee simple interest\nis called the fee tenant.\nFee simple estates, like all estates, remain subject to government restrictions\nand private interests.\nThere are two forms of fee simple estate: absolute and defeasible.\nExhibit 3.4 Fee Simple Estates\nFee Simple\nAbsolute\nDeterminable\nDefeasible\nCondition Subsequent\nFee Simple Absolute. The fee simple absolute estate is a perpetual estate that is\nnot conditioned by stipulated or restricted uses. It may also be freely passed on to\nheirs. For these reasons, the fee simple absolute estate is the most desirable estate\nthat can be obtained in residential real estate. It is also the most common.\n32 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Essential characteristics are:\n\uf034 the property must be used for a certain purpose or under certain\nconditions\n\uf034 if the use changes or if prohibited conditions are present, the\nestate reverts to the previous grantor of the estate.\nThe two types of fee simple defeasible are determinable and\ncondition subsequent.\nDeterminable. The deed to the determinable estate states usage limitations. If\nthe restrictions are violated, the estate automatically reverts to the grantor or\nheirs.\nCondition subsequent. If any condition is violated, the previous owner\nmay repossess the property. However, reversion of the estate is not\nautomatic: the grantor must re-take physical possession within a certain\ntime frame.\nLife estate A life estate is a freehold estate that is limited in duration to the life of the owner\nor other named person. Upon the death of the owner or other named individual,\nthe estate passes to the original owner or another named party. The holder of a\nlife estate is called the life tenant.\nThe distinguishing characteristics of the life estate are:\n\uf034 the owner enjoys full ownership rights during the estate period\n\uf034 holders of the future interest own either\na reversionary or a remainder interest\n\uf034 the estate may be created by agreement between private parties,\nor it may be created by law under prescribed circumstances.\nRemainder. If a life estate names a third party to receive title to the property\nupon termination of the life estate, the party enjoys a future interest called a\nremainder interest or a remainder estate. The holder of a remainder interest is\ncalled a remainderman.\nReversion. If no remainder estate is established, the estate reverts to the\noriginal owner or the owner's heirs. In this situation, the original owner retains\na reversionary interest or estate.\nThe two types of life estates are the conventional and the legal life estate.\nChapter 3: Interests and Estates 33",

John establishes that when Mary dies, the property\nwill revert to himself.\nPur autre vie. A pur autre vie life estate endures over the lifetime of a third\nperson, after which the property passes from the tenant holder to the original\ngrantor (reversion) or a third party (remainderman).\nFor example, Yvonne grants a life estate to Ryan, to endure over the lifetime of\nYvonne's husband Steve. Upon Steve's death, Yvonne establishes that her\nmother, Rose, will receive the property.\nLegal life estate A legal life estate is created by state law as opposed to being created by a\nproperty owner's agreement. Provisions vary from state to state. The focus of a\nlegal life estate is defining and protecting the property rights of surviving family\nmembers upon the death of the husband or wife.\nThe major forms of legal life estate are the homestead, and dower and\ncurtesy.\nHomestead. A homestead is one's principal residence. Homestead laws protect\nfamily members against losing their homes to general creditors attempting to\ncollect on debts.\nHomestead laws generally provide that:\n\uf034 all or portions of one's homestead are exempt from a forced\nsale executed for the collection of general debts (judgment\nliens). The various states place different limits on this\nexemption.\n\uf034 tax debts, seller financing debt, debts for home\nimprovement, and mortgage debt are not exempt\n\uf034 the family must occupy the homestead\n\uf034 the homestead interest cannot be conveyed by one spouse;\nboth spouses must sign the deed conveying homestead\nproperty\n\uf034 the homestead exemption and restrictions endure over the life of\nthe head of the household, and pass on to children under legal\nage. State laws define specifically how the interest transfers\nupon the death of the household head\n\uf034 homestead interests in a property are extinguished\nif the property is sold or abandoned\n\uf034 in some states the exemption is automatic; in others,\nhomeowners must file for the exemption.\nChapter 3: Interests and Estates 35",

Dower is a wife's life estate interest in the husband's\nproperty. When the husband dies, the wife can make a claim to portions of the\ndecedent's property. Curtesy is the identical right enjoyed by the husband in a\ndeceased wife's property. Property acquired under dower laws is owned by the\nsurviving spouse for the duration of his or her lifetime.\nLEASEHOLD ESTATES\nEstate for years\nEstate from period-to-period\nEstate at will\nEstate at sufferance\nA leasehold estate, or leasehold, arises from the execution of a lease by a fee\nowner- the lessor, or landlord-- to a lessee, or tenant. Since tenants do not own\nthe fee interest, a leasehold estate is technically an item of personal property for\nthe tenant.\nLeasehold tenants are entitled to possess and use the leased premises during the\nlease term in the manner prescribed in the lease. They also have restricted rights\nto exclusion.\nEstate for years The estate for years is a leasehold estate for a definite period of time, with a\nbeginning date and an ending date. The estate for years may endure for any\nlength of term. At the end of the term, the estate automatically terminates,\nwithout any requirement of notice.\nFor example, a landlord grants a tenant a three-year lease. After the three years,\nthe leasehold terminates, and the landlord may re-possess the premises, renew\nthe lease, or lease to someone else.\nIf a tenant with a leasehold estate for years remains in possession of the leased\npremises after lease expiration, a holdover lease is created. In the absence of a\nnew lease agreement stating otherwise, the holdover tenancy becomes a\nperiodic tenancy.\nEstate from\nperiod-to-period In an estate from period-to-period, also called a periodic tenancy, the\ntenancy period automatically renews for an indefinite period of time, subject\nto timely payment of rent. At the end of a tenancy period, if the landlord\naccepts another regular payment of rent, the leasehold is considered to be\nrenewed for another period.\nFor example, a two-year lease expires, and the landlord grants a six-month lease\nthat is automatically renewable, provided the monthly rent is received on time.

The acceptance of the rent automatically extends the\nleasehold for another six months.\nThe most common form of periodic tenancy is the month-to-month lease, which\nmay exist without any written agreement.\nEither party may terminate a periodic tenancy by giving proper notice to the\nother party. Proper notice is defined by state law.\nEstate at will The estate at will, also called a tenancy at will, has no definite expiration date\nand hence no \"renewal\" cycle. The landlord and tenant agree that the tenancy\nwill have no specified termination date, provided rent is paid on time and other\nlease conditions are met.\nFor example, a son leases a house to his father and mother \"forever,\" or until\nthey want to move.\nThe estate at will is terminated by proper notice, or by the death of either party.\nEstate at sufferance In an estate at sufferance, a tenant occupies the premises without consent of the\nlandlord or other legal agreement with the landlord. Usually such an estate\ninvolves a tenant who fails to vacate at the expiration of the lease, continuing\noccupancy without any right to do so.\nFor example, a tenant violates the provisions of a lease and is evicted. The\ntenant protests and refuses to leave despite the eviction order.\nChapter 3: Interests and Estates 37",
