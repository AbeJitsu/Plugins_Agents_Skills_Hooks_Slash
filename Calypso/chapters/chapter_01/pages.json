Within it one might include the construction industry, itself\noften considered our country's largest business. In addition, the real estate\nindustry may be said to include the creation, management, and demolition of\nevery residence and business facility in the nation: offices, warehouses, factories,\nstores, and special purpose buildings such as hospitals and government facilities.\nThe real estate business would include as well the managing of all the\nundeveloped land in the country: national parks, forests, and the vast quantity of\nunused federal property.\nReal estate professionals are individuals and business organizations whose sole\nenterprise is performing a real estate-related service or function. A wide range\nof professions is available to persons wishing to enter the real estate business.\nReal estate\nactivities Real estate professionals perform the following property-related functions:\n\uf034 creation and improvement\n\uf034 management and maintenance\n\uf034 demolition\n\uf034 investment ownership\n\uf034 regulation\n\uf034 transfer\nCreation and improvement. Creating real properties from raw land involves\ncapital formation, financing, construction contracting, and regulatory approvals.\nThe key parties involved in this aspect of the business are generally the\ndeveloper, the landowner, and the mortgage lender. Also involved are market\nanalysts, architects, engineers, space planners, interior designers, and\nconstruction subcontractors.\nChapter 1: The Real Estate Business 7",

    "text": "Experts who manage the legal aspects of the development project include real\nestate attorneys, title companies, surveyors, property insurance companies, and\ngovernment regulatory officials. The brokerage community, with the assistance\nof professional appraisers, usually handles the ownership and leasing\ntransactions that occur over the many phases of development.\nManagement and maintenance. All real estate, whether raw land or improved\nproperty, must be managed and maintained. The two principal types of\nmanagers are property managers and asset managers. Property managers and\ntheir staff oversee specific properties on behalf of the owners, making sure the\ncondition of the property and its financial performance meet specific standards.\nAsset managers oversee groups of properties, or portfolios. Their role is to\nachieve the investment objectives of the owners as opposed to managing day-\nto-day operations.\nMaintenance personnel include engineers, systems technicians, janitorial staff,\nand other employees needed to maintain the property's condition.\nDemolition. Demolition experts in conjunction with excavation and debris\nremoval experts serve to remove properties that are no longer economically\nviable from the market.\nInvestment ownership. A specialized niche in the real estate business is the\nreal estate investor who risks capital in order to buy, hold, and sell real\nproperties. In contrast to property owners whose primary interest is in some\nother business, the real estate investor focuses on identifying and exploiting real\nestate investment opportunities for profit. The real estate investor provides\ncapital and liquidity to the real estate market.\nRegulation. All real estate is to some degree regulated by government. The\nprincipal areas of regulation are usage, taxation, and housing administration.\nProfessional regulatory functions include public planners, zoning\nadministrators, building inspectors, assessors, and administrators of specific\nfederal statutes such as Federal Fair Housing Laws.\nTransfer. Rights and interests in real estate can be bought, sold, assigned,\nleased, exchanged, inherited, or otherwise transferred from one owner to\nanother. Real estate brokers and the brokers' salespeople are generally centrally\ninvolved in such transfers. Other professional participants are mortgage brokers,\nmortgage bankers, appraisers, insurers, and title companies.\n8 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

According to the purpose of ownership,\nproperties are classified as residential, commercial, or investment properties.\nResidential property refers to property that is owned and used for habitation.\nSuch properties may be further classified in terms of how many families they are\ndesigned to house, whether they are attached to other units or detached, and so\nforth.\nCommercial property generally refers to retail and office properties, but may\nalso include industrial real estate. The term \"commercial\" relates to the fact that\nthe property can potentially generate income from a business's usage.\nInvestment property refers to any property that is held by its owners for\ninvestment purposes. All classifications of property may be investment\nproperties. Generally, however, the term does not refer to owner-occupied\nresidences, even though such properties constitute an investment. Apartments,\ncondominiums, cooperatives, and single-family homes may be considered as\ninvestment property if non-occupants own the property for investment purposes.\nThese properties are also referred to as residential income properties.\nChapter 1: The Real Estate Business 9",

To help get the job done, the broker hires licensed\nagents as assistants.

    "text": "Forms of\nspecialization In the modern brokerage environment, brokers and agents specialize along the\nfollowing lines:\n\uf034 property type\n\uf034 geographical area\n\uf034 type of transaction\n\uf034 type of client\n\uf034 type of relationship\nOne's choice of specialization is influenced by competitive factors in the market\nand by perceived opportunities.\nProperty type. Since different properties have different features and potential\nbuyers, brokers commonly choose to specialize in a property type. Thus there\nare:\n\uf034 residential agents\n\uf034 commercial agents (office, retail)\n\uf034 industrial agents\n\uf034 land agents\nGeographical area. Brokers and agents must maintain current, accurate data\non properties. It is not possible to keep track of every property in larger\nmarkets. Therefore, one must create an area of geographical specialization.\nOne's area may be defined by natural barriers; by streets and highways; or by a\ncertain set of subdivisions.\nType of transaction. The principal types of transaction are sales, leases\nand subleases, exchanges, and options.\nEach form of transaction involves particular legal documents and considerations.\nAs a result, many agents, particularly commercial agents, specialize in a type of\ntransaction. For example, in an urban commercial property market, agents\ngenerally specialize in either leases or sales.\nType of client. Brokers increasingly represent buyers and tenants as well as\nsellers and landlords. Since conflicts of interest may be involved, many brokers\nrestrict their business to representing either buyers and tenants or sellers and\nlandlords exclusively.\nSome brokers and agents also specialize according to the type of business\ntheir clients are in or their motivations for the transaction. Thus one finds\nbrokers who focus exclusively on hospitals, or fast food chains, or executive\nrelocations.\nType of relationship. In recent years, many brokers have specialized in\nproviding advisory services to clients instead of the traditional transaction-based,\ncommission-compensated services. In the advisory relationship, the broker works\non identified real estate tasks or projects in exchange for a fee, salary, or retainer.\nThe fee advisor may or may not focus on completing a transaction.\nChapter 1: The Real Estate Business 11",

Federal and\nstate statutes, as well as a large body of court decisions, generally referred to as\ncommon law, circumscribe how real estate can be developed, managed, and\ntransferred.\nAmong the laws most relevant to agents and brokers are those relating to:\n\uf034 agency\n\uf034 contracts\n\uf034 disclosure\n\uf034 environmental impact\n\uf034 fair housing\nIn addition to federal, state, and local laws and regulations, the real estate\nindustry is, to a degree, self-regulated by the codes of ethical conduct\npropounded by the industry's many trade organizations. For example, the\nNational Association of Realtors\u00ae Code of Ethics not only reflects the law but\nsets an even higher standard of performance for member brokers and agents.\nIt is imperative for new practitioners to understand and abide by the many laws\nwhich regulate the industry.\nReal estate\nlicense laws State real estate license laws comprise the primary body of laws and regulations\ngoverning real estate brokerage practice. License laws in each state specify who\nmust obtain a license to practice real estate and set the requirements for\nobtaining and maintaining the license. License laws also define critical aspects\nof real estate brokerage, including\n\uf034 procedures for handling escrow deposits and fees\n\uf034 procedures for advertising\n\uf034 guidelines for dealing with clients and customers\nState license laws are administered in each state by a real estate commission.\nThe commission is charged with administering and enforcing license laws.

Real estate in the United States may be owned privately by\nindividuals and private entities or publicly by government entities. Private\nownership rights in this country are not absolute. The government can impose\ntaxes and restrictions on private ownership rights, and it can take private\nproperty away altogether. In addition, other private parties can exert their rights\nand interests on one's real property. A bank, for example, can take a property if\nthe owner fails to pay a mortgage. A neighbor can claim the right to walk across\none's property whether the owner likes it or not, provided he or she has done so\nfor a certain number of years.\nIn attempting to define real estate, it is essential to understand what rights and\ninterests parties have in a parcel of real estate. And to understand real estate\nrights and interests, one must first recognize the distinctions between:\n\uf034 land and real estate\n\uf034 real estate and property\n\uf034 real property and personal property\nLand The legal concept of land encompasses\n\uf034 the surface area of the earth\n\uf034 everything beneath the surface of the earth\nextending downward to its center\n\uf034 all natural things permanently attached to the earth\n\uf034 the air above the surface of the earth extending\noutward to infinity.\nLand, therefore, includes minerals beneath the earth's surface, water on or below\nthe earth's surface, and the air above the surface.

Land has three unique physical\ncharacteristics: immobility, indestructibility, and heterogeneity.\nLand is immobile, since a parcel of land cannot be moved from one site to\nanother. In other words, the geographical location of a tract of land is fixed and\ncannot be changed. One can transport portions of the land such as mined coal,\ndirt, or cut plants. However, as soon as such elements are detached from the\nland, they are no longer considered land.\nLand is indestructible in the sense that one would have to remove a segment of\nthe planet all the way to the core in order to destroy it. Even then, the portion\nextending upward to infinity would remain. For the same reason, land is\nconsidered to be permanent.\nLand is non-homogeneous, since no two parcels of land are exactly the same.\nAdmittedly, two adjacent parcels may be very similar and have the same\neconomic value. However, they are inherently different because each parcel has\na unique location.\nReal estate The legal concept of real estate encompasses:\n\uf034 land\n\uf034 all man-made structures that are\n\"permanently\" attached to the land\nReal estate therefore includes, in addition to land, such things as fences, streets,\nbuildings, wells, sewers, sidewalks and piers. Such man-made structures attached\nto the land are called improvements. The phrase \"permanently attached\" refers\nprimarily to one's intention in attaching the item. Obviously, very few if any\nmanmade structures can be permanently attached to the land in the literal sense.\nBut if a person constructs a house with the intention of creating a permanent\ndwelling, the house is considered real estate. By contrast, if a camper affixes a\ntent to the land with the intention of moving it to another camp in a week, the tent\nwould not be considered real estate.\nChapter 2: Rights in Real Estate 17",

Similarly,\nthe planet Jupiter is not property, since no one owns it.\nFrom a more technical standpoint, property is not only the item that is owned\nbut also a set of rights to the item enjoyed by the owner. These rights are\ncommonly known as the \"bundle of rights.\"\nExhibit 2.2 The Bundle of Rights\nIn owning property, one has the right to possess and use it as the law allows. The\nowner has the right to transfer ownership of the item (sell, rent, donate, assign, or\nbequeath). The owner may also encumber the item by mortgaging it as collateral\nfor debt.

Our legal system recognizes two classifications of\nproperty: real property and personal property. Real property is ownership of\nreal estate and the bundle of rights associated with owning the real estate.\nPersonal property is ownership of anything which is not real estate, and the\nrights associated with owning the personal property item. Items of personal\nproperty are also called chattels or personalty.\nNote: since all real estate in the United States is owned by some person,\nprivate organization, or government entity, all real estate in the country is real\nproperty. Given that fact, this text will follow the customary practice of using\nthe two terms interchangeably and synonymously.\nTangible versus intangible property. Real and personal property may be further\ncategorized as tangible or intangible property. Tangible property is physical,\nvisible, and material. Intangible property is abstract, having no physical existence\nin itself, other than as evidence of one's ownership interest.\nExhibit 2.3 Tangible vs. Intangible Property\nTangible Intangible\nReal Property all types\nPersonal boat, car, jewelry stock certificate,\nProperty contract, patent\nAll real estate, by its physical nature, is tangible property. Personal property\nmay be tangible or intangible. Boats, jewelry, coins, appliances, computers, and\nart work are examples of tangible personal property. Stocks, copyrights, bonds,\ntrademarks, patents, franchises, and listing agreements are examples of\nintangible personal property.\nReal property rights Real property rights consist of the bundle of rights associated with owning a\nparcel of real estate. Foremost of these rights is the right of possession.\nThe right to use a property refers to the right to use it in certain ways, such as\nmining, cultivating, landscaping, razing, and building on the property. The right\nis subject to the limitations of local zoning and the legality of the use. One's\nright to use may not infringe on the rights of others to use and enjoy their\nproperty. For example, an owner may be restricted from constructing a large\npond on her property if in fact the pond would pose flooding and drainage\nhazards to the next door neighbor.\nThe right to transfer interests in the property includes the right to sell, bequeath,\nlease, donate, or assign ownership interests. An owner may transfer certain\nindividual rights to the property without transferring total ownership. Also, one\nmay transfer ownership while retaining individual interests. For example, a\nChapter 2: Rights in Real Estate 19",

    "text": "person may sell mineral rights without selling the right of possession. On the\nother hand, the owner may convey all rights to the property except the mineral\nrights.\nWhile all rights are transferrable, the owner can only transfer what the owner in\nfact possesses. A property seller, for example, cannot sell water rights if there\nare no water rights attached to the property.\nThe right to encumber the property essentially means the right to mortgage the\nproperty as collateral for debt. There may be restrictions to this right, such as a\nspouse's right to limit the degree to which a homestead may be mortgaged.\nThe right to exclude gives the property owner the legal right to keep others off\nthe property and to prosecute trespassers.\nThe bundle of real property rights also applies separately to the individual\ncomponents of real estate: the air, the surface, and the subsurface. An owner can,\nfor example, transfer subsurface rights without transferring air rights. Similarly,\nan owner can rent air space without encumbering surface or subsurface rights.\nThis might occur in a city where adjoining building owners want to construct a\nwalkway over a third owner's lot. Such owners would have to acquire the air\nrights for the walkway. If the city wants to construct a subway through the\nowner's subsurface, the city has to obtain the subsurface rights to do so.\nAn ordinary lease is a common example of the transfer of a portion of one's\nbundle of rights. The owner relinquishes the right to possess portions of the\nsurface, perhaps a building, in return for rent. The tenant enjoys the rights to\npossess and use the building over the term of the lease, after which these rights\nrevert to the landlord. During the lease term, the tenant has no rights to the\nproperty's subsurface or airspace other than what the building occupies. Further,\nthe tenant does not enjoy any of the other rights in the bundle of rights: he\ncannot encumber the property or transfer it. To a limited degree, the tenant may\nexclude persons from the property, but he may not exclude the legal owner.\nSurface rights. Surface rights apply to the real estate contained within the\nsurface boundaries of the parcel. This includes the ground, all natural things\naffixed to the ground, and all improvements. Surface rights also include water\nrights.\nAir rights. Air rights apply to the space above the surface boundaries of the\nparcel, as delineated by imaginary vertical lines extended to infinity. Since the\nadvent of aviation, air rights have been curtailed to allow aircraft to fly over\none's property, provided the overflights do not interfere with the owner's use and\nenjoyment of the property. The issue of violation of air rights for the benefit of\nair transportation is an ongoing battle between airlines, airports, and nearby\nproperty owners.\nSubsurface rights. Subsurface rights apply to land beneath the surface of the\nreal estate parcel extending from its surface boundaries downward to the center\n20 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Notable subsurface rights are the rights to extract mineral and gas\ndeposits and subsurface water from the water table.\nWater rights Water rights basically concern the rights to own and use water found in lakes,\nstreams, rivers, and the ocean. In addition, they determine where parcel\nboundaries can be fixed with respect to adjoining bodies of water. What water\nrights does an owner of a property that contains or adjoins a body of water\nenjoy? The answer depends on three variables:\n\uf034 whether the state controls the water\n\uf034 whether the water is moving\n\uf034 whether the water is navigable\nDoctrine of Prior Appropriation. Since water is a resource necessary for\nsurvival, some states -- particularly those where water is scarce -- have taken the\nlegal position that the state owns and controls all bodies of water. Called the\nDoctrine of Prior Appropriation, this position requires that property owners\nobtain permits for use of water. If a proposed usage is reasonable and beneficial,\nthe state will grant a permit which, over time, can attach to the property of the\npermit holder. If a state does not operate under prior appropriation, it operates\nunder the common law doctrines of littoral rights and riparian rights.\nLittoral rights. Littoral rights concern properties abutting bodies of water that\nare not moving, such as lakes and seas. Owners of properties abutting a\nnavigable, non-moving body of water enjoy the littoral right of use, but do not\nown the water nor the land beneath the water. Ownership extends to the high-\nwater mark of the body of water.\nExhibit 2.4 Littoral Rights\nThe legal premise underlying the definition of littoral rights is that a lake or sea is\na navigable body of water, therefore, public property owned by the state. By\ncontrast, a body of water entirely contained within the boundaries of an owner's\nproperty is not navigable. In such a case, the owner would own the water as well\nas unrestricted rights of usage.\nChapter 2: Rights in Real Estate 21",

Riparian rights concern properties abutting moving water such\nas streams and rivers. If a property abuts a stream or river, the owner's riparian\nrights are determined by whether the water is navigable or not navigable. If the\nproperty abuts a non-navigable stream, the owner enjoys unrestricted use of the\nwater and owns the land beneath the stream to the stream's midpoint. If the\nwaterway in question is navigable, the waterway is considered to be a public\neasement. In such a case, the owner's property extends to the water's edge as\nopposed to the midpoint of the waterway. The state owns the land beneath the\nwater.\nExhibit 2.5 Riparian Rights\nOne's riparian rights to use flowing water are subject to the conditions that:\n\uf034 the usage is reasonable and does not infringe on the riparian\nrights of other owners downstream\n\uf034 the usage does not pollute the water\n\uf034 the usage does not impede or alter the course of the water flow.\nLike littoral rights, riparian rights attach to the property.\n22 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "REAL VERSUS PERSONAL\nPROPERTY\nFixtures\nDifferentiation criteria\nTrade fixtures\nEmblements\nFactory-built housing\nConversion\nIn conveying real property, it is vitally important to recognize the distinctions\nbetween personal property and the real property that is to be conveyed.\nConfusion can arise because items of property may be either personal property\nor real property, depending on circumstances.\nThe primary criterion for distinguishing real from personal property is whether\nthe item is permanently attached to the land or to structures attached to the land.\nFor example, a tree growing in one's yard is an item of real property. However,\nwhen the owner cuts the tree down, it becomes personal property. Similarly, a\nswimming pool pump on a shelf in the owner's garage is personal property. When\nit is installed with the rest of the pool, it becomes real property.\nWhile the \"attachment\" criterion is pivotal in distinguishing between real and\npersonal property, there are other tests to be applied. In addition, the\nattachment rule is subject to exceptions.\nFixtures A personal property item that has been converted to real property by\nattachment to real estate is called a fixture. Typical examples are chandeliers,\ntoilets, water pumps, septic tanks, and window shutters.\nThe owner of real property inherently owns all fixtures belonging to the real\nproperty. When the owner sells the real property, the buyer acquires rights to all\nfixtures. Fixtures not included in the sale must be itemized and excluded in the\nsale contract.\nDifferentiation\ncriteria In the event that the attachment criterion is insufficient to determine whether\nan article of property is real or personal, a court may apply one or more of\nthe following additional criteria.\nIntention. One's original intention can override the test of movability in\ndetermining whether an item is a fixture or not. If someone attached an item to\nreal property, yet intended to remove it after a period of time, the article may be\ndeemed personal property. If a person intended an article to be a fixture, even\nthough the item is easily removable, the article may be deemed a fixture.\nFor example, an apartment renter installs an alarm system, fully intending to\nremove the system upon lease expiration. Here, the alarm system would be\nconsidered personal property.\nAdaptation. If an item is uniquely adapted to the property, or the property is\ncustom-designed to accommodate the item, it may be deemed real property\nChapter 2: Rights in Real Estate 23",

    "text": "whether the item is easily removable or not. House keys, a garbage compactor,\nand a removable door screen are examples.\nFunctionality. If an item is vital to the operation of the building, it may be\ndeemed a fixture, even though perhaps easily removable. Window-unit air\nconditioners and detachable solar panels are possible examples.\nRelationship of parties. If a tenant installs a fixture in order to conduct business,\nthe fixture may be considered a trade fixture, which is the tenant's personal\nproperty.\nSale or lease contract provisions. In a sale or lease transaction, the listing of an\nitem in the contract as a personal property item or a fixture overrides all other\nconsiderations. Unless otherwise stated as exceptions, all fixtures are included in\nthe sale. For example, if a sale contract stipulates that the carpeting is not\nincluded in the sale, it becomes a personal property item. If the carpeting is not\nmentioned, it goes with the property, since it is attached to the floor of the\nbuilding.\nTrade fixtures Trade fixtures, or chattel fixtures, are items of a tenant's personal property that\nthe tenant has temporarily affixed to a landlord's real property in order to conduct\nbusiness. Trade fixtures may be detached and removed before or upon surrender\nof the leased premises. Should the tenant fail to remove a trade fixture, it may\nbecome the property of the landlord through accession. Thereafter, the fixture is\nconsidered real property.\nExamples of trade fixtures include a grocer's food freezers, a merchant's clothes\nracks, a tavern owner's bar, a dairy's milking machines, and a printer's printing\npress.\nEmblements Growing plants, including agricultural crops, may be either real property or\npersonal property. Plants and crops that grow naturally without requiring\nanyone's labor or machinery are considered real property.\nPlants and crops requiring human intervention and labor are called emblements.\nEmblements, despite their attachment to land, are considered personal property.\nIf an emblement is owned by a tenant farmer, the tenant has the right to the\nharvested crop whether the tenant's lease is active or expired. If the tenant grew\nthe crop, it is his or her personal property, and the landlord cannot take it.\nFactory-built\nhousing Factory-built housing consists of dwelling units constructed off-site and\ntransported to and assembled on a building site. The category also includes\nreadily moveable housing of the type that can be relocated from place to place,\nonce known by the term mobile home. The National Manufactured Housing\nConstruction and Safety Standards Act of 1976 defined the types of factory-built\nhousing and retired the mobile home designation. Manufactured housing is\nfactory-built housing that conforms to HUD standards. Factory-built housing\nmay be considered real property or personal property, depending on whether it is\npermanently affixed to the ground, and according to state law. Real estate\npractitioners should understand the local laws before selling any kind of factory-\nbuilt housing.\n24 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

If the\ninterest-holder enjoys the right of possession, the party is considered to have an\nestate in land, or, familiarly an estate. If a private interest-holder does not have\nthe right to possess, the interest is an encumbrance. If the interest-holder is not\nprivate, such as a government entity, and does not have the right to possess, the\ninterest is some form of public interest.\nAn encumbrance enables a non-owning party to restrict the owner's bundle of\nrights. Tax liens, mortgages, easements, and encroachments are examples.\nPublic entities may own or lease real estate, in which case they enjoy an estate in\nland. However, government entities also have non-possessory interests in real\nestate which act to control land use for the public good within the entity's\njurisdiction.

Upon Steve's death, Yvonne establishes that her\nmother, Rose, will receive the property.\nLegal life estate A legal life estate is created by state law as opposed to being created by a\nproperty owner's agreement. Provisions vary from state to state. The focus of a\nlegal life estate is defining and protecting the property rights of surviving family\nmembers upon the death of the husband or wife.\nThe major forms of legal life estate are the homestead, and dower and\ncurtesy.\nHomestead. A homestead is one's principal residence. Homestead laws protect\nfamily members against losing their homes to general creditors attempting to\ncollect on debts.\nHomestead laws generally provide that:\n\uf034 all or portions of one's homestead are exempt from a forced\nsale executed for the collection of general debts (judgment\nliens). The various states place different limits on this\nexemption.\n\uf034 tax debts, seller financing debt, debts for home\nimprovement, and mortgage debt are not exempt\n\uf034 the family must occupy the homestead\n\uf034 the homestead interest cannot be conveyed by one spouse;\nboth spouses must sign the deed conveying homestead\nproperty\n\uf034 the homestead exemption and restrictions endure over the life of\nthe head of the household, and pass on to children under legal\nage. State laws define specifically how the interest transfers\nupon the death of the household head\n\uf034 homestead interests in a property are extinguished\nif the property is sold or abandoned\n\uf034 in some states the exemption is automatic; in others,\nhomeowners must file for the exemption.\nChapter 3: Interests and Estates 35",

Dower is a wife's life estate interest in the husband's\nproperty. When the husband dies, the wife can make a claim to portions of the\ndecedent's property. Curtesy is the identical right enjoyed by the husband in a\ndeceased wife's property. Property acquired under dower laws is owned by the\nsurviving spouse for the duration of his or her lifetime.\nLEASEHOLD ESTATES\nEstate for years\nEstate from period-to-period\nEstate at will\nEstate at sufferance\nA leasehold estate, or leasehold, arises from the execution of a lease by a fee\nowner- the lessor, or landlord-- to a lessee, or tenant. Since tenants do not own\nthe fee interest, a leasehold estate is technically an item of personal property for\nthe tenant.\nLeasehold tenants are entitled to possess and use the leased premises during the\nlease term in the manner prescribed in the lease. They also have restricted rights\nto exclusion.\nEstate for years The estate for years is a leasehold estate for a definite period of time, with a\nbeginning date and an ending date. The estate for years may endure for any\nlength of term. At the end of the term, the estate automatically terminates,\nwithout any requirement of notice.\nFor example, a landlord grants a tenant a three-year lease. After the three years,\nthe leasehold terminates, and the landlord may re-possess the premises, renew\nthe lease, or lease to someone else.\nIf a tenant with a leasehold estate for years remains in possession of the leased\npremises after lease expiration, a holdover lease is created. In the absence of a\nnew lease agreement stating otherwise, the holdover tenancy becomes a\nperiodic tenancy.\nEstate from\nperiod-to-period In an estate from period-to-period, also called a periodic tenancy, the\ntenancy period automatically renews for an indefinite period of time, subject\nto timely payment of rent. At the end of a tenancy period, if the landlord\naccepts another regular payment of rent, the leasehold is considered to be\nrenewed for another period.\nFor example, a two-year lease expires, and the landlord grants a six-month lease\nthat is automatically renewable, provided the monthly rent is received on time.

Proper notice is defined by state law.\nEstate at will The estate at will, also called a tenancy at will, has no definite expiration date\nand hence no \"renewal\" cycle. The landlord and tenant agree that the tenancy\nwill have no specified termination date, provided rent is paid on time and other\nlease conditions are met.\nFor example, a son leases a house to his father and mother \"forever,\" or until\nthey want to move.\nThe estate at will is terminated by proper notice, or by the death of either party.\nEstate at sufferance In an estate at sufferance, a tenant occupies the premises without consent of the\nlandlord or other legal agreement with the landlord. Usually such an estate\ninvolves a tenant who fails to vacate at the expiration of the lease, continuing\noccupancy without any right to do so.\nFor example, a tenant violates the provisions of a lease and is evicted.

A joint tenant may transfer his or her interest in the\nproperty to an outside party, but only as a tenancy in common interest. Whoever\nacquires the interest co-owns the property as a tenant in common with the other\njoint tenants. The remaining joint tenants continue to own an undivided interest\nin the property, less the new cotenant's share.\nSurvivorship. In most states, joint tenants enjoy rights of survivorship: if a joint\ntenant dies, all interests and rights pass to the surviving joint tenants free from\nany claims of creditors or heirs.\nIn other states, joint tenancy does not inherently include survivorship;\nsurvivorship must be expressly stated to be effected on transfer.\nWhen only one joint tenant survives, the survivor's interest becomes an estate in\nseveralty, and the joint tenancy is terminated. The estate will be then probated\nupon the severalty owner's death.\nThe survivorship feature of joint tenancy presents an advantage to tenancy in\ncommon, in that interests pass without probate proceedings.

Condominium properties have extensive management\nrequirements, including maintenance, sales and leasing, accounting, owner\nservices, sanitation, security, trash removal, etc. The association engages\nprofessional management companies, resident managers, sales and rental agents,\nspecialized maintenance personnel, and outside service contractors to fulfill\nthese functions.\nOwner\nresponsibilities Individual units. Owner responsibilities relating to the apartment include:\n\uf034 maintaining internal systems\n\uf034 maintaining the property condition\n\uf034 insuring contents of the unit\nCommon area assessments. Unit owners bear the costs of all other property\nexpenses, such as maintenance, insurance, management fees, supplies, legal\nfees, and repairs. An annual operating budget totals these expenses and passes\nthem through as assessments to unit owners, usually on a monthly basis.\n50 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

For example,\nif a unit represents a 2% share of the property value, that unit owner's\nassessment will be 2% of the property's common area expenses.\nCOOPERATIVES\nInterests, rights, and obligations\nOrganization and management\nIn a cooperative, or co-op, one owns shares in a non-profit corporation or\ncooperative association, which in turn acquires and owns an apartment building\nas its principal asset. Along with this stock, the shareholder acquires a\nproprietary lease to occupy one of the apartment units.\nThe number of shares purchased reflects the value of the apartment unit in\nrelation to the property's total value. The ratio of the unit's value to total value\nalso establishes what portions of the property's expenses the owner must pay.\nExhibit 4.5 The Cooperative\nThe exhibit shows a nine-unit apartment building. A cooperative corporation\nbuys the building for $900,000. All nine units are of equal size, so the\ncorporation decides that each apartment represents a value of $100,000, or 1/9 of\nthe total. The co-op buyer pays the corporation $100,000 and receives 1/9 of the\ncorporation's stock. The shareholder also receives a proprietary lease for\nChapter 4: Ownership 51",

The corporate entity of the cooperative\nassociation is the only party in the cooperative with a real property interest.\nThe association's interest is an undivided interest in the entire property. There\nis no ownership interest in individual units, as with a condominium.\nShareholder's interest. In owning stock and a lease, a co-op unit owner's interest\nis personal property that is subject to control by the corporation. Unlike\ncondominium ownership, the co-op owner owns neither a unit nor an undivided\ninterest in the common elements.\nProprietary lease. The co-op lease is called a proprietary lease because the\ntenant is an owner (proprietor) of the corporation that owns the property. The\nlease has no stated or fixed rent. Instead, the proprietor-tenant is responsible for\nthe unit's pro rata share of the corporation's expenses in supporting the\ncooperative. Unit owners pay monthly assessments. The proprietary lease has no\nstated term and remains in effect over the owner's period of ownership. When\nthe unit is sold, the lease is assigned to the new owner.\nExpense liability. The failure of individual shareholders to pay monthly\nexpense assessments can destroy the investment of all the other co-op owners\nif the co-op cannot pay the bills by other means.\nSince the corporation owns an undivided interest in the property, debts and\nfinancial obligations apply to the property as a whole, not to individual units.\nShould the corporation fail to meet its obligations, creditors and mortgagees may\nforeclose on the entire property. A completed foreclosure would terminate the\nshareholders' proprietary lease, and bankrupt the owning corporation. Compare\nthis situation with that of a condominium, in which an individual's failure to pay\nendangers only that individual's unit, not the entire property.\nTransfers. The co-op interest is transferred by assigning both the stock\ncertificates and lease to the buyer.\nOrganization and\nmanagement A developer creates a cooperative by forming the cooperative association, which\nsubsequently buys the cooperative property. The association's articles of\nincorporation, bylaws, and other legal documents establish operating policies,\nrules, and restrictions.\nThe shareholders elect a board of directors. The board assumes the responsibility\nfor maintaining and operating the cooperative, much like a condominium board.\nCooperative associations, however, also control the use and ownership of\nindividual apartment units, since they are the legal owners. A shareholder's\nvoting power is proportional to the number of shares owned.\n52 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "TIME-SHARES\nTime-share lease\nTime-share freehold\nRegulation\nTime-share ownership is a fee or leasehold interest in a property whose owners\nor tenants agree to use the property on a periodic, non-overlapping basis. This\ntype of ownership commonly concerns vacation and resort properties. Time-\nshare arrangements provide for equal sharing of the property's expenses among\nthe owners.\nTime-share lease In a leasehold time-share, the tenant agrees to rent the property on a scheduled\nbasis or under any pre-arranged system of reservation, according to the terms of\nthe lease. Generally, the scheduled use is denominated in weeks or months over\nthe duration of the lease, a specified number of years.\nTime-share freehold In a freehold time-share, or interval ownership estate, tenants in common own\nundivided interests in the property. Expense prorations and rules governing\ninterval usage are established by separate agreement when the estate is\nacquired.\nFor instance, the Blackburns want a monthly vacation in Colorado once a\nyear. They find a time-share condominium that needs a twelfth buyer. The\navailable month is May, which suits the Blackburns. The total price of the\ncondominium is $240,000, and annual expenses are estimated to be $9,600.\nThe Blackburns buy a one-twelfth interest with the other tenants in common\nby paying their share of the price, $20,000. They are also obligated to pay\none-twelfth of the expenses every year, or $800. They have use of the\nproperty for one-twelfth of the year, in the month of May.\nInterval owners must usually waive the right of partition, which would enable\nan owner to force the sale of the entire property.\nRegulation The development and sale of time-share properties has come under increased\nregulation in recent years. Developers and brokers in many states face more\nstringent disclosure requirements regarding ownership costs and risks. Other\nlaws provide for a cooling-off period after the signing of a time-share sales\ncontract, and require registration of advertising.\nChapter 4: Ownership 53",

In effect, an encumbrance is another's right to use or\ntake possession of a legal owner's property, or to prevent the legal owner from\nenjoying the full bundle of rights in the estate.\nAn encumbrance does not include the right of possession and is therefore a\nlesser interest than the owner's freehold interest. For that reason,\nencumbrances are not considered estates. However, an encumbrance can lead\nto the owner's loss of ownership of the property.\nEasements and liens are the most common types of encumbrance. An\neasement, such as a utility easement, enables others to use the property,\nregardless of the owner's desires. A lien, such as a tax lien, can be placed on\nthe property's title, thereby restricting the owner's ability to transfer clear title\nto another party.\nThe two general types of encumbrance are those that affect the property's use\nand those that affect legal ownership, value and transfer.\nChapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 55",

Easement\nrights may apply to a property's surface, subsurface, or airspace, but the\naffected area must be defined.\nThe receiver of the easement right is the benefited party; the giver of the\neasement right is the burdened party.\nEssential characteristics of easements include the following:\n\uf034 An easement must involve the owner of the land over which\nthe easement runs, and another, non-owning party. One cannot\nown an easement over one's own property.\n\uf034 an easement pertains to a specified physical area within the\nproperty boundaries\n\uf034 an easement may be affirmative, allowing a use, such as a right-\nof-way, or negative, prohibiting a use, such as an airspace\neasement that prohibits one property owner from obstructing\nanother's ocean view\nThe two basic types of easement are appurtenant and gross.\nEasement\nappurtenant An easement appurtenant gives a property owner a right of usage to portions of\nan adjoining property owned by another party. The property enjoying the usage\nright is called the dominant tenement, or dominant estate. The property\ncontaining the physical easement itself is the servient tenement, since it must\nserve the easement use.\n56 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

More specifically, the easement attaches as a beneficial\ninterest to the dominant estate, and as an encumbrance to the servient estate. The\neasement appurtenant then becomes part of the dominant estate's bundle of\nrights and the servient estate's obligation, or encumbrance.\nTransfer. Easement appurtenant rights and obligations automatically transfer\nwith the property upon transfer of either the dominant or servient estate,\nwhether mentioned in the deed or not. For example, John grants Mary the right\nto share his driveway at any time over a five-year period, and the grant is duly\nrecorded. If Mary sells her property in two years, the easement right transfers to\nthe buyer as part of the estate.\nNon-exclusive use. The servient tenement, as well as the dominant tenement,\nmay use the easement area, provided the use does not unreasonably obstruct the\ndominant use.\nExhibit 5.2 Easements appurtenant\nThe exhibit shows a conventional easement appurtenant. The driveway marked\nA belongs to parcel #2. An easement appurtenant, marked B, allows parcel #3 to\nuse #2's driveway. Parcel #3 is the dominant tenement, and #2 is the servient\ntenement.\nEasement by necessity. An easement by necessity is an easement appurtenant\ngranted by a court of law to a property owner because of a circumstance of\nnecessity, most commonly the need for access to a property. Since property\ncannot be legally landlocked, or without legal access to a public thoroughfare, a\ncourt will grant an owner of a landlocked property an easement by necessity\nChapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 57",

A party wall is a common wall shared by two\nseparate structures along a property boundary.\nParty wall agreements generally provide for severalty ownership of half of the\nwall by each owner, or at least some fraction of the width of the wall. In\naddition, the agreement grants a negative easement appurtenant to each owner in\nthe other's wall. This is to prevent unlimited use of the wall, in particular a\ndestructive use that would jeopardize the adjacent property owner's building.\nThe agreement also establishes responsibilities and obligations for maintenance\nand repair of the wall.\nFor example, Helen and Troy are adjacent neighbors in an urban housing\ncomplex having party walls on property lines. They both agree that they\nseparately own the portion of the party wall on their property. They also grant\neach other an easement appurtenant in their owned portion of the wall. The\neasement restricts any use of the wall that would impair its condition. They also\nagree to split any repairs or maintenance evenly.\nOther structures that are subject to party agreements are common fences,\ndriveways, and walkways.\nEasement in gross An easement in gross is a personal right that one party grants to another to use\nthe grantor's real property. The right does not attach to the grantor's estate. It\ninvolves only one property, and, consequently, does not benefit any property\nowned by the easement owner.

A personal gross easement\ndiffers from a license in that the grantor of a license may revoke the usage right.\nThe exhibit shows that a beachfront property owner (A) has granted a neighbor\n(B) across the street the right to cross A's property to reach the beach.\nCommercial. A commercial easement in gross is granted to a business entity\nrather than a private party. The duration of the commercial easement is not tied to\nanyone's\nlifetime.

A survey may\nbe required to detect or demonstrate the existence of an encroachment.\nAn owner may sue for removal of an encroachment or for compensation for\ndamages. If an encroached owner takes no remedial action over a prescribed\nnumber of years, the encroachment may become an easement by prescription.\nLICENSES\nA license, much like a personal easement in gross, is a personal right that a\nproperty owner grants to another to use the property for a specific purpose.\nLicenses are not transferrable and do not attach to the land. They cease on the\ndeath of either party, or on the sale of the property.\nUnlike a personal easement in gross, a license is revocable at any time.

If the owner defaults, the lien gives the creditor the right\nto force the sale of the property to satisfy the debt.\nFor example, a homeowner borrows $5,000 to pay for a new roof. The lender\nfunds the loan in exchange for the borrower's promissory note to repay the loan.\nAt the same time, the lender places a lien on the property for $5,000 as security\nfor the debt. If the borrower defaults, the lien allows the lender to force the sale\nof the house to satisfy the debt.\nThe example illustrates that a lien is an encumbrance that restricts free and clear\nownership by securing the liened property as collateral for a debt. If the owner\nsells the property, the lienholder is entitled to that portion of the sales proceeds\nneeded to pay off the debt.

Thus, a real estate tax lien (senior) recorded on June\n15 has priority over an income tax lien (junior) recorded on June 1.\nA junior lien is automatically inferior, or subordinate, to a superior lien.\nAmong junior liens, date of recording determines priority. The rule is: the\nearlier the recording date of the lien, the higher its priority. For example, if a\njudgment lien is recorded against a property on Friday, and a mortgage lien is\nrecorded on the following Tuesday, the judgment lien has priority and must be\nsatisfied in a foreclosure ahead of the mortgage lien.\nThe mechanic's lien is an exception to the recording rule. Its priority dates from\nthe point in time when the work commenced or ended, as state law determines,\nrather than from when it was recorded.\nThe following example illustrates how lien priority works in paying off secured\ndebts.

The lender may require the borrower to obtain agreements from other\nlien holders to subordinate their liens to the new mortgage.\nFor example, interest rates fall from 8% to 6.5% on first mortgages for principal\nresidences. A homeowner wants to refinance her mortgage, but she also has a\nseparate home-equity loan on the house. Since the first-mortgage lender will not\naccept a lien priority inferior to a home equity loan, the homeowner must\npersuade the home equity lender to subordinate the home equity lien to the new\nfirst-mortgage lien.\nSuperior liens Real estate tax lien. The local legal taxing authority annually places a real\nestate tax lien, also called an ad valorem tax lien, against properties as security\nfor payment of the annual property tax. The amount of a particular lien is based\non the taxed property's assessed value and the local tax rate.\nSpecial assessment lien. Local government entities place assessment liens\nagainst certain properties to ensure payment for local improvement projects\nsuch as new roads, schools, sewers, or libraries. An assessment lien applies only\nto properties that are expected to benefit from the municipal improvement.\nFederal and state inheritance tax liens. Inheritance tax liens arise from\ntaxes owed by a decedent's estate. The lien amount is determined through\nprobate and attaches to both real and personal property.\nJunior liens Tax liens. All tax liens other than those for ad valorem, assessment, and estate\ntax are junior liens. They include:\n\uf034 federal income tax lien\nplaced on a taxpayer's real and personal property for failure to\npay income taxes\n66 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

A judgment lien attaches to real and personal property as a\nresult of a money judgment issued by a court in favor of a creditor. The creditor\nmay obtain a writ of execution to force the sale of attached property and collect\nthe debt. After paying the debt from the sale proceeds, the debtor may obtain a\nsatisfaction of judgment to clear the title records on other real property that\nremains unsold.\nDuring the course of a lawsuit, the plaintiff creditor may secure a writ of\nattachment to prevent the debtor from selling or concealing property. In such a\ncase, there must be a clear likelihood that the debt is valid and that the defendant\nhas made attempts to sell or hide property.\nCertain properties are exempt from judgment liens, such as homestead property\nand joint tenancy estates.\nMortgage and trust deed lien. In lien-theory states, mortgages and trust deeds\nsecure loans made on real property. In these states, the lender records a lien as\nsoon as possible after disbursing the funds in order to establish lien priority.\nVendor's lien. A vendor's lien, also called a seller's lien, secures a purchase\nmoney mortgage, a seller's loan to a buyer to finance the sale of a property.\nMunicipal utility lien. A municipality may place a utility lien against a\nresident's real property for failure to pay utility bills.\nMechanic's lien. A mechanic's lien secures the costs of labor, materials, and\nsupplies incurred in the repair or construction of real property improvements. If\na property owner fails to pay for work performed or materials supplied, a worker\nor supplier can file a lien to force the sale of the property and collect the debt.\nAny individual who performs approved work may place a mechanic's lien on the\nproperty to the extent of the direct costs incurred. Note that unpaid\nsubcontractors may record mechanic's liens whether the general contractor has\nbeen paid or not. Thus it is possible for an owner to have to double-pay a bill in\norder to eliminate the mechanic's lien if the general contractor neglects to pay\nthe subcontractors. The mechanic's lienor must enforce the lien within a certain\ntime period, or the lien expires.\nChapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 67",

If a borrower has failed to meet loan obligations in spite\nof proper notice and applicable grace periods, the lender can accelerate the loan,\nor declare that the loan balance and all other sums due on the loan are payable\nimmediately.\nIf the borrower does not pay off the loan in full, the lender then files a\nforeclosure suit, naming the borrower as defendant. The suit asks the court\nto:\n\uf034 terminate the defendant's interests in the property\n\uf034 order the property sold publicly to the highest bidder\n\uf034 order the proceeds applied to the debt\nLis Pendens. In the foreclosure suit, a lis pendens gives public notice that the\nmortgaged property may soon have a judgment issued against it.

If the defendant fails to meet the demands of the suit during\na prescribed period, the court orders the termination of interests of any and all\nparties in the property, and orders the property to be sold. The court's writ of\nexecution authorizes an official, such as the county sheriff, to seize and sell the\nforeclosed property.\nPublic sale and sale proceeds. After public notice of the sale, the property is\nauctioned to the highest bidder. The new owner receives title free and clear of\nall previous liens, whether the lienholders have been paid or not.

If the sale does not yield sufficient funds to cover the\namounts owed, the mortgagee may ask the court for a deficiency judgment.\nThis enables the lender to attach and foreclose a judgment lien on other real or\npersonal property the borrower owns.\nRight of redemption. The borrower's right of redemption, also called equity of\nredemption, is the right to reclaim a property that has been foreclosed by paying\noff amounts owed to creditors, including interest and costs. Redemption is\npossible within a redemption period. Some states allow redemption during the\nforeclosure proceeding at any time \"until the gavel drops\" at the sale. Other states\nhave statutory periods of up to a year following the sale for the owner of a\nforeclosed property to redeem the estate. Also see right to reinstate on page 255\nin Chapter 17.\nNon-judicial\nforeclosure When there is a \"power of sale\" provision in the mortgage or trust deed\ndocument, a non-judicial foreclosure can force the sale of the liened property\nwithout a foreclosure suit. The \"power of sale\" clause in effect enables the\nmortgagee to order a public sale without court decree.\nForeclosure process. On default, the foreclosing mortgagee records and\ndelivers notice to the borrower and other lienholders. After the proper period, a\n\"notice of sale\" is published, the sale is conducted, and all liens are\nextinguished. The highest bidder then receives unencumbered title to the\nproperty.\nDeficiency suit. The lender does not obtain a deficiency judgment or lien in a\nnon-judicial foreclosure action. The lender instead must file a new deficiency\nsuit against the borrower.\nRe-instatement and redemption. During the notice of default and notice of\nsale periods, the borrower may pay the lender and terminate the proceedings.\nExact re-instatement periods vary from state to state. There is no redemption\nright in non-judicial foreclosure.\nStrict foreclosure Strict foreclosure is a court proceeding that gives the lender title directly, by\ncourt order, instead of giving cash proceeds from a public sale.\nOn default, the lender gives the borrower official notice. After a prescribed\nperiod, the lender files suit in court, whereupon the court establishes a period\nwithin which the defaulting party must repay the amounts owed. If the defaulter\ndoes not repay the funds, the court orders transfer of full, legal title to the\nlender.\nDeed in lieu of\nforeclosure A defaulting borrower who faces foreclosure may avoid court actions and costs\nby voluntarily deeding the property to the mortgagee. This is accomplished with\na deed in lieu of foreclosure , which transfers legal title to the lienholder. The\ntransfer, however, does not terminate any existing liens on the property.\n70 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

More\naccurately, someone who possesses all ownership interests owns legal title to the\nproperty. Legal title is distinct from equitable title, which is the interest or right\nto obtain legal title to a property in accordance with a sale or mortgage contract\nbetween the legal owner and a buyer or creditor. During the contractual period of\ntime when ownership of legal title is contingent upon the contract, the buyer or\nlender owns equitable title to the property.\nFor example, a buyer enters into a contract for deed to purchase a house. The\nseller lends the bulk of the purchase price to the buyer for a term of three years.\nThe buyer takes possession of the property, and makes payments on the loan.\nDuring this period, the seller retains legal title, and the buyer owns equitable\ntitle. If the buyer fulfills the terms of the agreement over the three year period,\nthe buyer has an enforceable contract to obtain legal title.\nAnother common example is a mortgage loan transaction that gives the lender\nthe right to execute a strict foreclosure, which transfers legal title to the lender\nin the event of a default. With this contractual right, the lender has equitable\ntitle to the property.\n.\nIn practice, the terms \"title\" and \"legal title\" are often used interchangeably.\nNotice of title In any legal system that permits private ownership of real property, there will always\nbe disputes as to who truly owns a particular parcel of real estate. For example,\nan owner might \"sell\" his property to three unrelated parties. The first party buys\nthe property at the earliest date, the second party pays the highest price, and the\nthird party receives the best deed, a warranty deed. Who owns legal title to the\nproperty?\nChapter 6: Transferring and Recording Title 73",

    "text": "Ownership of legal title is a function of evidence. A court will generally rule that\nthe person who has the preponderance of evidence of ownership is the owner of\nthe property. In the example, if the first two buyers did not receive a deed while\nthe third party did, the third party may have the best evidence and be ruled the\nlegal title-holder. However, what if the first buyer had moved into the house and\noccupied it for six months before the original owner sold the property to the\nsecond and third buyers? And what if the second buyer, after searching title\nrecords, reports that the seller never really owned the property and therefore\ncould not legally sell it to anyone! Now who owns the property?\nThe illustration underscores the difficulty of proving title to real estate: there is\nno absolute and irrefutable proof that a party holds legal title. Our legal system\nhas developed two forms of title evidence-- actual notice and constructive\nnotice-- to assist in the determination.\nActual notice. The term \"notice\" is synonymous with \"knowledge.\" A person\nwho has received actual notice has actual knowledge of something. Receiving\nactual notice means learning of something through direct experience or\ncommunication. In proving real estate ownership, a person provides actual\nnotice by producing direct evidence, such as by showing a valid will. Another\nparty receives actual notice by seeing direct evidence, such as by reviewing the\ndeed, reading title records, or physically visiting the property to see who is in\npossession. Thus if Mary Pierce drives to a property and sees directly that John\nDoe is in possession of the home, Mary then has received actual notice of John\nDoe's claim of ownership. Her knowledge is obtained through direct\nexperience.\nConstructive notice. Constructive notice, or legal notice, is knowledge of a\nfact that a person could have or should have obtained. The foremost method of\nimparting constructive notice is by recordation of ownership documents in\npublic records, specifically, title records. Since public records are open to\neveryone, the law generally presumes that when evidence of ownership is\nrecorded, the public at large has received constructive notice of ownership. By\nthe same token, the law presumes that the owner of record is in fact the legal\nowner. Thus, if John Doe records the deed of conveyance, he has imparted, and\nMary Pierce has received, constructive notice of ownership. Possession of the\nproperty can also be construed as constructive notice, since a court may rule\nthat Mary should have visited the property to ascertain whether it was occupied.\nA combination of actual and constructive notice generally provides the\nmost indisputable evidence of real property ownership.\nTransferring title Transfer of title to real estate, also called alienation, occurs voluntarily and\ninvoluntarily. When the transfer uses a written instrument, the transfer is\ncalled a conveyance.\n74 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

If\nthe transferor is a private party, the conveyance is a private grant.\nA living owner makes a private grant by means of a deed of conveyance, or\ndeed. A private grant that occurs when the owner dies is a transfer by will.\nInvoluntary alienation. Involuntary alienation is a transfer of title to real\nproperty without the owner's consent.

A quitclaim deed transfers real and potential interests in a\nproperty, whether an interest is known to exist or not.

It\ndescribes how the maker of the will, called the testator or devisor, wants the\nproperty distributed. A beneficiary of a will is called an heir or devisee. The\nproperty transferred by the will is the devise.\nA will takes effect only after the testator's death. It is an amendatory\ninstrument, meaning that it can be changed at any time during the maker's\nlifetime.\nCommonly, the testator names an executor, or personal representative, to\noversee the settlement of the estate.

If the decedent died with a valid will, the court hears the\nclaims of lienors and creditors and determines their validity. First in line are\nthe superior liens: those for real estate taxes, assessment taxes, federal estate\ntaxes, and state inheritance taxes. If the estate's liquid assets are insufficient to\npay all obligations, the court may order the sale of personal or real property to\nsatisfy the obligations.\nThe court must also hear and satisfy legal life estate claims, including those for\ndower, curtesy, homestead, and elective share. These interests may prevail even\nif the will does not provide for them.\nOnce all claims have been satisfied, the balance of the estate's assets passes to\nthe rightful heirs free and clear of all liens and debts.\nIntestate proceeding with heirs. If the decedent died without a valid will, the\nestate passes to lawful heirs according to the state's laws of descent and\ndistribution, or succession. Laws of descent stipulate who inherits and what\nshare they receive, without regard to the desires of the heirs or the intentions of\nthe deceased.\nFor example, John Astor dies intestate, leaving a wife and four children. The\nlaws of descent in his state provide that the surviving spouse receives one-third\nof the estate, and the four children receive equal shares of the remaining two\nthirds.\nIntestate proceeding with no heirs. If an intestate decedent has no heirs, the\nestate escheats, or reverts, to the state or county after all claims and debts have\nbeen validated and settled.\n82 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "INVOLUNTARY TITLE TRANSFER\nLaws of descent\nAbandonment\nForeclosure\nEminent domain\nAdverse possession\nEstoppel\nState law regulates all forms of involuntary alienation, whether such transfer\noccurs by the laws of descent, abandonment, foreclosure, eminent domain,\nadverse possession, or estoppel.\nLaws of descent Involuntary alienation occurs when a title-holder dies without a valid will. The\nstate's statutes of descent and distribution identify heirs and the respective shares\nof the estate they will receive. In the absence of heirs, title transfers to the state\nor county by escheat.\nAbandonment Property that has been abandoned for a statutory period may also escheat to the\nstate or county.\nForeclosure A property owner who fails to fulfill loan obligations or pay taxes may lose an\nestate through foreclosure.\nEminent domain Various government and public entities can transfer private property to the\npublic sphere by the power of eminent domain. The transfer is involuntary, even\nthough the owner receives compensation. For example, a city government wants\nto widen a highway to accommodate growth. The government uses eminent\ndomain to condemn and purchase all properties abutting the thoroughfare in\norder to complete the construction project.\nAdverse possession State laws may allow a real property owner to lose legal title to an adverse\npossessor. An adverse possessor is someone who enters, occupies, and uses\nanother's property without the knowledge or consent of the owner, or with the\nknowledge of an owner who fails to take any action over a statutory period of\ntime.\nTo claim legal title, the adverse possessor must:\n\uf034 be able to show a claim of right or color of title as reason\nfor the possession\n\uf034 have notorious possession, which is possession without\nconcealment\n\uf034 maintain a consistent claim of hostile possession, which is a\nclaim to ownership and possession regardless of the owner's\nclaims or consent\n\uf034 occupy the property continuously for a statutory period of time\n\uf034 in some states, pay taxes\nChapter 6: Transferring and Recording Title 83",

    "text": "A claim of right is based on the adverse possessor's occupying and maintaining\nthe property as if he or she were the legal owner. Color of title results when a\ngrantee has obtained defective title, or received title by defective means, but\noccupies the property as if he or she were the legal owner. A court may hold that\na claim of right or a claim of colored title is a valid reason for the possession.\nNotorious possession and hostile possession give constructive notice to the\npublic, including the legal owner, that a party other than the legal owner is\noccupying and claiming to own the property. It is possible for such notice to\nprevail over notice by recordation as the dominant evidence of legal ownership,\nprovided the possessor has occupied the property continuously for the statutory\nperiod of time.\nIn some states, the possessor must have paid taxes over a prescribed period to\nobtain title. However, if the possessor has paid rent of any kind, the claim of\nownership might be refuted.\nAvoiding adverse possession. An owner can avert the danger of involuntary\nalienation by adverse possession by periodically inspecting the property within\nstatutory deadlines and evicting any trespassers found. The owner may also sue\nto quiet title, which would eliminate the threat of the adverse possessor's claim\nto legal title.\nA property registered in the Torrens system cannot be lost to adverse possession.\nEstoppel Estoppel prevents a person from claiming a right or interest that is inconsistent\nwith the person's previous statements or acts. As a basis for involuntary\nalienation, the doctrine of estoppel can prevent an owner from re-claiming a\nproperty that was transferred under false pretenses. For example, an owner\nconveys a property with a defective title. The grantor is fully aware of the defect\nbut makes no disclosure to the grantee. The grantor later cures the defect and then\nclaims to be the rightful owner of the property on the basis of the effort and\nexpense of clearing the title. Estoppel disallows the grantor's claim because of the\nprior conveyance action. The grantee remains legal owner and benefits from the\ncleared title as well.\nTITLE RECORDS\nChain of title\nRecording system\nTitle evidence\nState laws require the recording of all documents that affect rights and interests\nin real estate in the public real estate records of the county where the property is\nlocated. These public records, or title records, contain a history of every parcel\nof real estate in the county, including names of previous owners, liens,\neasements, and other encumbrances that have been recorded.\n84 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Other public records that affect real estate title are\nmarriage, probate, and tax records.\nGenerally, a County Recorder's Office or other similarly named office maintains\nthe title records.\nTitle records serve a number of purposes, not the least of which is to\navoid ownership disputes. Other important purposes are:\n\uf034 Public notice\nTitle records protect the public by giving all concerned parties\nconstructive notice of the condition of a property's legal title:\nwho owns the property, who maintains claims and\nencumbrances against the property.\n\uf034 Buyer protection\nTitle records protect the buyer by revealing whether a property\nhas marketable title, one free of undesirable encumbrances. The\nbuyer is legally responsible for knowing the condition of title,\nsince it is a matter of public record. Recording a transaction also\nprotects a buyer by replacing the deed as evidence of ownership.\n\uf034 Lienholder protection\nTitle records protect the lienholder by putting the public on notice\nthat the lien exists, and that it may be the basis for a foreclosure\naction. Recording also establishes the lien's priority.\nChain of title Chain of title refers to the succession of property owners of record dating back to\nthe original grant of title from the state to a private party. If there is a missing\nlink in the chronology of owners, or if there was a defective conveyance, the\nchain is said to be broken, resulting in a clouded title to the property. To remove\nthe cloud, an owner may need to initiate a suit to quiet title, which clears the\ntitle record of any unrecorded claims.\nAbstract of Title. An abstract of title is a written, chronological summary of the\nproperty's title records and other public records affecting rights and interests in\nthe property. It includes the property's chain of title and all current recorded liens\nand encumbrances, by date of filing. A title abstractor or title company analyst\nconducts the search of public records, called a title search, needed to produce an\nabstract. Insurers and lenders generally require the search to identify title defects\nand ascertain the current status of encumbrances.\nA title plant is a duplicate set of records of a property copied from public\nrecords and maintained by a private company, such as a title company.\nRecording system There are no federal recording standards. Each state prescribes procedures\nand requirements for recording in public title records: forms, proper\nexecution, acknowledgment, and witnessing.\nChapter 6: Transferring and Recording Title 85",

    "text": "The Torrens system. Certain states and counties use the Torrens system of\nrecording. The Torrens system differs from other title recording systems in that\ntitle passes only when the conveyance has been duly registered on the title\ncertificate itself. Encumbrances likewise have no legal effect until they are\nrecorded. In effect, the Torrens title record is the title itself. It is not necessary to\nsearch public records to ascertain the status of title; it is all reflected on the title\ncertificate.\nTo enter a property in the Torrens system, a court action must first clear title by\ngiving notice to all potential interest holders that they must express their claims.\nAt the end of the proceeding, the court decrees that the title is accepted into\nTorrens registration. The Torrens registry retains the original registration\ndocuments and provides copies to the recorder or other appropriate office. All\nsubsequent transactions affecting title must follow the proper Torrens recording\nprocedures and requirements.\nTitle evidence Marketable title. Since the value of a property is only as good as the\nmarketability of its title, the evidence supporting the status of title is a\nsignificant issue. To demonstrate marketable title to a buyer, a seller must\nshow that the title is free of\n\uf034 doubts about the identity of the current owner\n\uf034 defects, such as an erroneous legal description\n\uf034 claims that could affect value\n\uf034 undisclosed or unacceptable encumbrances\nIn the conventional residential transaction, a buyer's best assurance of\nmarketable title is the title company itself. The title company's due diligence\nin preparing for closing is to investigate the status of the property's title,\ncomplete with liens, claims and encumbrances. This process involves various\nforms of title search and chain-of-title investigation. In essence, if any of\nthese activities uncover title clouds or claims prior to closing, the title\ncompany will stop the closing process until the problem is cleared up.\nThe culmination of the pre-closing title work is obtaining a completed title\ninsurance policy, which in itself is one of the best available assurances of\nclear, marketable title.\nThe four principal forms of evidence in support of the status of marketable title\nare:\n\uf034 a Torrens certificate\n\uf034 a title insurance policy\n\uf034 an attorney's opinion of the title abstract\n\uf034 a title certificate\nTorrens certificate. If available, the Torrens certificate is the best evidence,\nfor the reasons given earlier-- it is not merely a record, but is the title itself.\nTitle insurance. In the absence of Torrens registration, a title insurance policy is\ncommonly accepted as the best evidence of marketable title. A title insurance\npolicy indemnifies the policy holder against losses arising from defects in the\ninsured title.\n86 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The common policy types are the lender's policy and the owner's policy, which\nprotect the respective policy holders' interests in the property. Thus, a lender\nwho holds an $80,000 mortgage on a property will obtain protection worth\n$80,000 against the possibility that the lender's lien cannot be enforced. The\nowner's policy will insure against defective title to the extent of the property's\ninitial or appreciated value.\nAn owner's policy may have standard coverage or extended coverage.\nStandard coverage protects against title defects such as incompetent grantors,\ninvalid deeds, fraudulent transaction documents, and defects in the chain of\ntitle. Extended coverage protects against liabilities that may not be of public\nrecord, including fraud, unrecorded ownership claims, unintentional recording\nerrors, and unrecorded liens. Extended coverage may also protect against\nadverse possessors, boundary disputes, and prescriptive easements. Neither\nstandard nor extended coverage insures against defects expressly excluded by\nthe policy or defects that the owner might have been aware of but did not\ndisclose.\nBefore issuing a title insurance policy, a title company conducts a title search\nto uncover defects in title or unrecorded breaks in the chain of title. If the\nsearch fails to discover any uninsurable defects, the company issues a binder,\nor commitment to insure. The binder recapitulates the property description,\ninterest to be insured, names of insured parties, and exceptions to coverage.\nAttorney's opinion of abstract. An attorney's opinion of abstract states that\nthe attorney has examined a title abstract, and gives the attorney's opinion of\nthe condition and marketability of the title. Generally, an opinion is not a\nproof or guarantee of clear title. Further, it offers no protection in the event\ntitle turns out to be defective. Also known as opinion of title.\nTitle certificate. A title certificate is a summary of the condition of title as of\nthe date of the certificate, based on a search of public records by an abstractor\nor title analyst.

As a conveyance, a lease\nconveys an interest, called the leasehold estate, but does not convey legal title to\nthe property. For this reason, a leasehold is also called a less-than-freehold\nestate.\nThe four principal types of leasehold estate are:\n\uf034 estate for years: has a specific lease term\n\uf034 estate from period-to-period: the lease term automatically\nrenews\n\uf034 estate at will: has no specified lease term\n\uf034 estate at sufferance: a tenancy without consent\nThe legal essence of a valid lease is that it conveys an exclusive right to use and\noccupy a property for a limited period of time in exchange for rent and the return\nof the property after the lease term is over. Leasehold estates are distinguished\nfrom freeholds by their temporary nature. Every leasehold has a limited duration,\nwhether the term is 99 years or not stated at all, as in an estate at will. While the\nlease conveys exclusive use, it may also restrict such use to conform to the\nlandlord's desires. For example, an apartment lease may prohibit a tenant from\nusing or storing hazardous materials within the premises.\nLike other contracts, a lease becomes a binding agreement when the parties\naccept the terms of the agreement and communicate their agreement to the other\nparty. Recording of a leasehold conveyance is not a requirement for validity,\nalthough it is usually good procedure to do so.\nIn a lease arrangement, the owner is the landlord, or lessor, and the renter is\nthe tenant, or lessee.\n90 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Leasehold rights\nand obligations Tenant's rights and obligations. A lease conveys a leasehold interest or\nestate that grants the tenant the following rights during the lease term:\n\uf034 exclusive possession and occupancy\n\uf034 exclusive use\n\uf034 quiet enjoyment\n\uf034 profits from use\nA tenant has the sole right to occupy and use the premises without interference\nfrom outside parties, including the landlord. The landlord may enter the premises\nfor specified purposes such as inspections, but the interference must be\nreasonable and limited. In addition, the landlord can do nothing outside of the\nlease's express provisions that would impair the tenant's enjoyment of income\nderiving from use of the premises. For example, the landlord can not place a\nkiosk in front of a retail tenant's entry in such a way as to prevent customers\nfrom entering the store.\nThe lease defines the tenant's obligations, which principally are to:\n\uf034 pay the rent on time\n\uf034 maintain the property's condition\n\uf034 comply with the rules and regulations of the building\nLandlord's rights and obligations. In conveying the leasehold estate, the\nlandlord acquires a leased fee estate, which entails the rights to:\n\uf034 receive rent\n\uf034 re-possess the property following the lease term\n\uf034 monitor the tenant's obligations to maintain the premises\nThe lease defines the landlord's obligations, which principally are to:\n\uf034 provide the necessary building support and services\n\uf034 maintain the condition of the property\nDeath of tenant or landlord. A valid lease creates obligations that survive the\ndeath of the landlord or tenant, with certain exceptions. A tenant's estate\nremains liable for payment of rent if the tenant dies; the landlord's estate\nremains bound to provide occupancy despite the landlord's death.\nConveyance of leased property. The landlord may sell, assign, or mortgage\nthe leased fee interest. However, transferring and encumbering the leased\nproperty do not extinguish the obligations and covenants of a lease. Buyers and\ncreditors, therefore, must take their respective interests subject to the terms of\nthe lease.\nContract\nrequirements State contract laws determine the requirements for a valid lease. These\nlaws generally require the following conditions.\nParties. The principal parties must be legally able to enter into the agreement;\ni.e., meet certain age, sanity, and other requirements.\nChapter 7: Leasing Essentials 91",

    "text": "Property description. The lease must identify the property by legal description\nor other locally accepted reference.\nExclusive possession. The landlord must provide an irrevocable right to\nexclusive possession during the lease term, provided the tenant meets all\nobligations.\nLegal and permitted use. The intended use of the property must be legal. A\nuse that is legal but not permitted does not invalidate the lease but constitutes\ngrounds for default.\nConsideration. The lease contract must be accompanied by consideration to the\nlandlord for the rights conveyed. How the consideration is paid does not affect\nthe lease's validity, so long as the parties comply with the terms of the lease.\nOffer and acceptance. The parties must accept the lease, and communicate\ntheir acceptance to the other party, for the lease to take legal effect.\nSignatures. The landlord must sign the lease to convey the leasehold interest. A\ntenant need not sign the lease, although it is prudent to do so in order to enforce\nthe terms of the lease. Multiple tenants who sign a single lease are jointly and\nseverally responsible for fulfilling lease obligations. Thus, if one renter\nabandons an apartment, the other renters remain liable for rent.\nOral versus written form. Generally, a lease for a period exceeding one year\ncannot be oral but must be in writing to be enforceable because of the Statute of\nFrauds. An oral lease or rental agreement is legally construed to be a tenancy at\nwill, having no specified term. Further, an oral lease terminates on the death of\neither principal party.\nLease clauses The clauses of a lease define the contractual relationship between landlord\nand tenant. The most important and basic clauses are the following.\nRent and security deposit. A rent clause stipulates the time, place, manner and\namount of rent payment. It defines any grace period that is allowed, and states\nthe penalties for delinquency.\nThe lease may also call for a security deposit to protect the landlord against\nlosses from property damage or the tenant's default. State law regulates the\nhandling of the security deposit: where it is deposited, and whether the tenant\nreceives interest on the deposit. A landlord may require additional financial\nsecurity from a tenant of dubious creditworthiness in the form of personal\nguarantees, third party guarantees, or pledges of other property as collateral.\nLease term. In the absence of an explicit term with beginning and ending date,\na court will generally construe the lease to be a tenancy at will, cancelable upon\nproper notice.\nRepairs and maintenance. Repairs and maintenance provisions define the\nlandlord's and tenant's respective responsibilities for property repairs and\nmaintenance. Generally, the tenant is responsible for routine maintenance of the\npremises while the landlord is responsible for general repairs. In residential\nleases, the landlord is responsible for major repairs and capital improvements.\nPayment of repairs and maintenance costs, however, is entirely negotiable\nbetween landlord and tenant.\n92 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Subletting and assignment. Subletting (subleasing) is the transfer by a tenant,\nthe sublessor, of a portion of the leasehold interest to another party, the\nsublessee, through the execution of a sublease. The sublease spells out all of the\nrights and obligations of the sublessor and sublessee, including the payment of\nrent to the sublessor. The sublessor remains primarily liable for the original\nlease with the landlord. The subtenant is liable only to the sublessor.\nFor example, a sublessor subleases a portion of the occupied premises for a\nportion of the remaining term. The sublessee pays sublease rent to the sublessor,\nwho in turn pays lease rent to the landlord.\nAn assignment of the lease is a transfer of the entire leasehold interest by a\ntenant, the assignor, to a third party, the assignee. There is no second lease, and\nthe assignor retains no residual rights of occupancy or other leasehold rights\nunless expressly stated in the assignment agreement. The assignee becomes\nprimarily liable for the lease and rent, and the assignor, the original tenant,\nremains secondarily liable. The assignee pays rent directly to the landlord.\nAll leases clarify the rights and restrictions of the tenant regarding subleasing\nand assigning the leasehold interest. Generally, the landlord cannot prohibit\neither act, but the tenant must obtain the landlord's written approval. The reason\nfor this requirement is that the landlord has a financial stake in the\ncreditworthiness of any prospective tenant.\nRules and regulations. A tenant must abide by all usage restrictions imposed\nby the lease's rules and regulations for the property. These rules aim to protect\nthe property's condition as well as the rights of other tenants.\nImprovements and alterations. A landlord typically wants to prevent a tenant\nfrom making alterations that later tenants may not desire. By the same token, a\ntenant who pays for an improvement wants to know who will own it at the end\nof the lease term. An improvements and alterations clause therefore identifies\nnecessary permissions and procedures, and who owns improvements.\nCustomarily, tenant improvements become the property of the landlord in the\nabsence of an express agreement to the contrary.\nOptions. An option clause offers a tenant the opportunity to choose a course of\naction at some time in the future under certain terms. Typical options are the\nright to renew the lease, buy the property, and lease additional adjacent space. A\ntenant does not have to exercise an option, but the landlord must comply if the\ntenant does exercise it.\nDamage and destruction. A damage and destruction provision defines the\nrights and obligations of the parties in the event the leased premises are\ndamaged or destroyed. State laws regulate such provisions.\nChapter 7: Leasing Essentials 93",

Rent levels under a gross lease are higher than under a\nnet lease, since the landlord recoups expense outlays in the form of added\nrent.\nGross leases are common for office and industrial properties. Residential leases\nare usually gross leases with the exception that the tenants often pay utilities\nexpenses.\nNet lease A net lease requires a tenant to pay for utilities, internal repairs, and a\nproportionate share of taxes, insurance, and operating expenses in addition to\nrent. In effect, the landlord \"passes through\" actual property expenses to the\ntenant rather than charging a higher rent level. Net leases vary as to exactly what\nexpenses the tenant is responsible for. The extreme form of net lease requires\ntenants to cover all expenses, including major repairs and property taxes.\nNet leases are common for office and industrial properties. They are sometimes\nalso used for single family dwellings.\nIn practice, the terms net and gross lease can be misleading: some gross leases\nstill require tenants to pay some expenses such as utilities and repairs. Similarly,\nsome net leases require the landlord to pay certain expenses. Prudent tenants and\nlandlords look at all expense obligations in relation to the level of rent to be\ncharged.\nPercentage lease A percentage lease allows the landlord to share in the income generated from\nthe use of the property. A tenant pays percentage rent, or an amount of rent\nequal to a percentage of the tenant's periodic gross sales. The percentage rent\nmay be:\n\uf034 a fixed percent of gross revenue without a minimum rent\n\uf034 a fixed minimum rent plus an additional percent of gross sales\n\uf034 a percentage rent or minimum rent, whichever is greater\nPercentage leases are used only for retail properties.\nResidential lease A residential lease may be a net lease or a gross lease. Usually, it is a form of\ngross lease in which the landlord pays all property expenses except the\ntenant's utilities and water. Since residential leases tend to be short in term,\ntenants cannot be expected to pay for major repairs and improvements. The\n94 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

As a rule, a commercial lease is a significant and complex\nbusiness proposition. It may involve hundreds of thousands of dollars for\nimproving the property to the tenant's specifications. Since the lease terms are\noften long, total rent liabilities for the tenant can easily be millions of dollars.\nSome important features of commercial leases are:\n\uf034 long term, ranging up to 25 years\n\uf034 require tenant improvements to meet particular usage needs\n\uf034 virtually all lease clauses are negotiable due to the financial\nmagnitude of the transaction\n\uf034 default can have serious financial consequences; therefore,\nlease clauses must express all points of agreement and be\nvery precise\nGround lease A ground lease, or land lease, concerns the land portion of a real property.\nThe owner grants the tenant a leasehold interest in the land only, in exchange\nfor rent.\nGround leases are primarily used in three circumstances:\n\uf034 an owner wishes to lease raw land to an agricultural or mining\ninterest\n\uf034 unimproved property is to be developed and either the owner\nwants to retain ownership of the land, or the developer or future\nusers of the property do not want to own the land\n\uf034 the owner of an improved property wishes to sell an interest in the\nimprovements while retaining ownership of the underlying land\nIn the latter two instances, a ground lease offers owners, developers, and users\nvarious financing, appreciation, and tax advantages. For example, a ground lease\nlessor can take advantage of the increase in value of the land due to the new\nimprovements developed on it, without incurring the risks of developing and\nowning the improvements. Land leases executed for the purpose of development\nor to segregate ownership of land from ownership of improvements are\ninherently long term leases, often ranging from thirty to fifty years.\nProprietary lease A proprietary lease conveys a leasehold interest to an owner of a cooperative.\nThe proprietary lease does not stipulate rent, as the rent is equal to the owner's\nshare of the periodic expenses of the entire cooperative.

The rights lease may be very specific, stating how much of a\nmineral or other resource may be extracted, how the rights may be exercised, for\nwhat period of time, and on what portions of the property. The lessee's rights do\nnot include common leasehold interests such as occupancy, exclusion, quiet\nenjoyment, or possession of the leased premises.\nAnother example of a rights lease is where a railroad wants to erect a bridge\nover a thoroughfare owned by a municipality. The railroad must obtain an air\nrights agreement of some kind, whether it be an easement, a purchase, or a\nlease, before it can construct the bridge.\nDEFAULT AND TERMINATION\nRemedies for default\nDefault by tenant\nDefault by landlord\nCauses for lease termination\nRemedies for default A landlord or tenant who violates any of the terms and covenants of the lease\nhas breached the contract and is in default. In the event of a default, the\ndamaged party may pursue court action, including suing for\n\uf034 damages\n\uf034 cancellation of the lease\n\uf034 specific performance\nA successful suit for specific performance compels the defaulting party to\nperform the contract obligation that was breached. For example, if a landlord fails\nto replace carpeting as promised in the lease, the tenant can sue to obtain the\nlandlord's specific performance of installing a new carpet.\nDefault by tenant Tenant default occurs most commonly from failure to pay rent or maintain the\npremises. If a tenant is in default, the landlord may file a suit for possession,\nalso called a suit for eviction. If successful in this suit, the landlord can\nrepossess the property and evict the tenant. The landlord also has the right to\nsue for damages.\nBefore filing a suit for possession, the landlord must give the tenant proper\nnotice to pay monies due or otherwise cure the default before a deadline, or else\nvacate the premises. If the deadline passes without satisfaction, the landlord may\n96 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The landlord may then obtain\nan order directing the sheriff to complete the eviction, forcibly if necessary.\nDefault by landlord The most common form of landlord default is failure to provide services and\nmaintain the property condition. When a landlord defaults on the terms of the\nlease, tenants may sue for damages. In an instance where the landlord's\nnegligence or disruptive action has rendered the property unoccupiable, a tenant\nmay vacate the premises and declare that the lease is cancelled by default. This\naction, called constructive eviction, can nullify the tenant's lease obligations if\nthe claim succeeds in court. In order to obtain a constructive eviction judgment,\nthe tenant must vacate the premises.\nFor example, a landlord will not repair a roof and will not allow an office\ntenant to make the repair and deduct the cost from the rent. A thunderstorm\nsoaks the suite and ruins several pieces of office equipment. By refusing to act,\nthe landlord has breached the lease covenant to maintain the premises. The\ntenant moves out, claiming the lease null and void. The tenant also sues the\nlandlord for damages to the equipment and for recovery of relocation expenses.\nCauses for lease\ntermination A lease may terminate for any of the following causes.\nBreach or default. Breach of contract or default, as previously discussed,\nmay terminate a lease.\nTerm expiration. In a tenancy for years, the lease automatically terminates\nat the end of the lease term.\nNotice. Proper notice by either party may terminate a periodic leasehold, or\na tenancy at will.\nVoluntary agreement. Both parties can agree to terminate a lease at any\ntime.\nProperty destruction. Destruction of the property is grounds for\nterminating lease obligations.\nCondemnation. A taking by eminent domain proceedings generally\nterminates a lease.\nForeclosure. A foreclosure extinguishes all prior interests in a property,\nincluding a leasehold.\nDeath of tenant or landlord, with qualifications. A lease for tenancy at\nwill terminates on the death of either landlord or tenant. A lease also\nterminates on the death of the landlord if the landlord held a life estate\ninterest in the property, since the landlord could not have conveyed an\ninterest that extended beyond his or her own interest.\nExcept in the circumstances mentioned, a lease does not terminate on the\ndeath of the landlord or tenant. Sale of the property also does not terminate a\nlease.\nAbandonment. If a tenant abandons a leased property and demonstrates no\nintention of fulfilling the obligations of the lease, the landlord may re-take\npossession and pursue legal recourses for default. In such a case, the tenant\nremains liable for payment of rent. The landlord also has the option of\nterminating the lease, which releases the tenant from responsibility for rent.\nChapter 7: Leasing Essentials 97",

Numerous states have\nenacted tenant-landlord regulations in response to the law.\nThe act aims to:\n\uf034 equalize and standardize rights of landlord and tenant\n\uf034 protect tenants from unethical practices\n\uf034 prevent unfair, complex leases and their enforceability\nOne important effect of URLTA is that it prompted legislation at the state level\nthat empowered the courts to nullify residential leases that violated URLTA\nguidelines, particularly where a lease gave unfair advantage to the landlord.\nAreas of regulation URLTA legislation primarily addresses the lease contract, deposits and\nadvances, obligations of landlord and tenant, the landlord's rights of access,\nand standards for eviction.\nLease agreements. URLTA sets standards for improving oral,\nvague, or unbalanced lease agreements. The law's positions on these\nissues are:\n\uf034 unclear lease term: becomes a periodic tenancy\n\uf034 rent amount: fair market value or court's opinion\n\uf034 waiving of rights: certain rights cannot be waived\nThe law intends to avoid irregularities and vagueness in the lease term and rent\nobligations, as these can cause exaggeration in a landlord's claim for the\namount of rent due from a defaulting tenant. A vague lease term can also lead\nto a dispute about the duration of a tenant's possession rights. A landlord, for\nexample, could claim that a lease has expired in order to acquire a higher-\npaying tenant. URLTA also discourages the landlord practice of persuading\ntenants to waive rights they do not understand or are unaware of.\nDeposit and advance. URLTA requires leases to be clear about:\n\uf034 maximum deposit amount\n\uf034 the tenant's right to earn interest on the deposit\n98 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

URLTA attempts to balance the landlord's right to access the premises\nwith the tenant's right of quiet enjoyment. The landlord has the right to enter the\npremises at any time when acting to prevent damage or destruction; to make\nrepairs or show the property, on giving proper notice; if the purpose is not\narbitrary and the time is reasonable The tenant may not refuse the landlord entry\nfor acceptable reasons such as emergencies, repairs, inspections, and showings.\nDefault and eviction. URLTA attempts to establish equitable procedures for\ndealing with lease defaults. If the landlord defaults, a tenant may sue for\ndamages, terminate the agreement, or negotiate a rent abatement. Tenants\ngenerally are not released of liability for rent during a dispute. Rents, however,\nmay be paid to a court impound pending judgment. If a tenant defaults, the\nlandlord may terminate and evict, provided proper notice is made and the\nlandlord can justify the cause for the action.\nExemptions. State laws based on URLTA generally do not apply to transient\noccupancies, such as hotel and motel rentals, proprietary leases in cooperatives,\nor to occupancy in a residence that is under a contract for deed.\nChapter 7: Leasing Essentials 99",

As American history demonstrates, unregulated use of real estate has\nsignificant potential for eventual damage to property values as well as to the\nenvironment. Moreover, with the explosive urban growth in this century, it has\nbecome clear that regulation of land use is necessary to preserve the interests,\nsafety, and welfare of the community.\nWithout a central authority to exert control, land use tends to be chaotic. For\nexample, rapid growth can outpace the support capabilities of basic municipal\nservices such as sewers, power, water, schools, roads and communications. On\nan aesthetic level, communities need controls to keep certain commercial and\nindustrial land uses away from residential areas to avoid the undermining of\nproperty values by pollution, noise, and traffic congestion.\nGoals of land use\ncontrol Over time, public and private control of land use has come to focus on certain\ncore purposes. These are:\n\uf034 preservation of property values\n\uf034 promotion of the highest and best use of property\n\uf034 balance between individual property rights and the public good,\ni.e., its health, safety and welfare\n\uf034 control of growth to remain within infrastructure capabilities\n\uf034 incorporation of community consensus into regulatory and\nplanning activities\nThe optimum management of real property usage must take into account both\nthe interests of the individual and the interests of the surrounding community.\nWhile maintaining the value of an individual estate is important, the owner of\nan estate must realize that unregulated use and development can jeopardize\nthe value not only of the owner's estate but of neighboring properties.\nSimilarly, the community must keep in mind the effect of government actions\nChapter 8: Land Use Planning and Control 101",

Private controls are\nprimarily implemented by deed restrictions.\nThe master plan Public land use planning incorporates long-term usage strategies and growth\npolicies in a land use plan, or master plan. In many states, the process of land\nuse planning begins when the state legislature enacts laws requiring all counties\nand municipalities to adopt a land use plan. The land use plan must not only\nreflect the needs of the local area, but also conform to state and federal\nenvironmental laws and the plans of regional and state planning agencies. The\nstate enforces its planning mandates by giving state agencies the power to\napprove county and local plans.\nThe master plan therefore fuses state and regional land use laws with local land\nuse objectives that correspond to the municipality's social and economic\nconditions. The completed plan becomes the overall guideline for creating and\nenforcing zones, building codes, and development requirements.\n102 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The Constitution grants the states the\nlegal authority to regulate, and the states delegate the authority to counties and\nmunicipalities through legislation called enabling acts.\nThe zoning ordinance. The vehicle for zoning a city or county is the zoning\nordinance, a regulation enacted by the local government. The intent of zoning\nordinances is to specify land usage for every parcel within the jurisdiction. In\nsome areas, state laws permit zoning ordinances to apply to areas immediately\nbeyond the legal boundaries of the city or county.\nZoning ordinances implement the master plan by regulating density, land\nuse intensity, aesthetics, and highest and best use.

Local governments enforce zoning ordinances by issuing\nbuilding permits to those who want to improve, repair, or refurbish a property.\nTo receive a permit, the project must comply with all relevant ordinances and\ncodes. Further zoning enforcement is achieved through periodic inspections.\nTypes of zones. One of the primary applications of zoning power is the\nseparation of residential properties from commercial and industrial uses.

In\neffect, the zoning board is a court of appeals for owners and developers who\ndesire to use land in a manner that is not entirely consistent with existing\nordinances.\nThe board conducts hearings of specific cases and renders official\ndecisions regarding the land use based on evidence presented.\nA zoning board generally deals with such issues and appeals as:\n\uf034 nonconforming use\n\uf034 variance\n\uf034 special exception or conditional use permit\n\uf034 zoning amendment\nIf the board rejects an appeal, the party may appeal the ruling further in a court\nof law.\nExhibit 8.2 Zoning Appeals\nNon- Special\nconforming exception\nuse\n--public good\n--legal\n--illegal\nZoning Board\nof\nAdjustment\nVariance Amendment\n--hardship --change\nzone\nNonconforming use. A nonconforming use is one that clearly differs from\ncurrent zoning. Usually, nonconforming uses result when a zoning change\nleaves existing properties in violation of the new ordinance. This type of\nnonconforming use is a legal nonconforming use. A board usually treats this\nkind of situation by allowing it to continue either\nChapter 8: Land Use Planning and Control 107",

    "text": "\uf034 indefinitely\n\uf034 until the structures are torn down\n\uf034 only while the same use continues, or\n\uf034 until the property is sold\nFor instance, a motel is situated in a residential area that no longer allows\ncommercial activity. The zoning board rules that the motel may continue to\noperate until it is sold, destroyed or used for any other commercial purpose.\nAn illegal nonconforming use is one that conflicts with ordinances that\nwere in place before the use commenced. For instance, if the motel in the\nprevious example is sold, and the new owner continues to operate the\nproperty as a motel, the motel is now an illegal, nonconforming use.\nVariance. A zoning variance allows a use that differs from the applicable\nordinance for a variety of justifiable reasons, including that:\n\uf034 compliance will cause unreasonable hardship\n\uf034 the use will not change the essential character of the area\n\uf034 the use does not conflict with the general intent of the ordinance\nFor example, an owner mistakenly violates a setback requirement by two feet.\nHis house is already constructed, and complying with the full setback now\nwould be extremely expensive, if not impossible. The zoning board grants a\nvariance on the grounds that compliance would cause an unreasonable hardship.\nA grant of a zoning variance may be unconditional, or it may require\nconditions to be fulfilled, such as removing the violation after a certain time.\nSpecial exception. A special exception grant authorizes a use that is not\nconsistent with the zoning ordinance in a literal sense, yet is clearly beneficial\nor essential to the public welfare and does not materially impair other uses in\nthe zone.\nA possible example is an old house in a residential zone adjacent to a retail\nzone. The zoning board might grant a special exception to a local group that\nproposes to renovate the house and convert it to a local museum, which is a\nretail use, since the community stands to benefit from the museum.\nAmendment. A current or potential property owner may petition the zoning\nboard for an outright change in the zoning of a particular property. For example,\na property zoned for agricultural use has been idle for years. A major employer\ndesires to develop the property for a local distribution facility, which would\ncreate numerous jobs, and petitions for an amendment. The board changes the\nzoning from agricultural to light industrial to permit the development. Since a\nchange in zoning can have significant economic and social impact, an appeal for\nan amendment is a difficult process that often involves public hearings.\nSubdivision\nregulation In addition to complying with zoning ordinances, a developer of multiple\nproperties in a subdivision must meet requirements for subdivisions.\n108 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The\nplat, as a minimum, shows that the plan complies with local zoning and building\nordinances.

Many states have adopted policies that require developers,\nespecially of subdivisions, to take responsibility for the impact of their projects\non the local infrastructure by taking corrective action. Concurrency is a policy\nthat requires the developer to make accommodations concurrently with the\ndevelopment of the project itself, not afterwards. For example, if a project will\ncreate a traffic overload in an area, the developer may have to widen the road\nwhile constructing the project.\nFHA requirements. In addition to local regulation, subdivisions must meet FHA\n(Federal Housing Authority) requirements to qualify for FHA financing\ninsurance. The FHA sets standards similar to local ordinances to ensure an\nadequate level of construction quality, aesthetics, and infrastructure services.\nBuilding codes Building codes allow the county and municipality to protect the public against\nthe hazards of unregulated construction. Building codes establish standards for\nvirtually every aspect of a construction project, including offsite improvements\nsuch as streets, curbs, gutters, drainage systems, and onsite improvements such\nas the building itself.\nBuilding codes typically address:\n\uf034 architectural and engineering standards\n\uf034 construction materials standards\n\uf034 building support systems such as life safety, electrical,\nmechanical, and utility systems\nCertificate of occupancy. Building inspectors inspect a new development or\nimprovement for code compliance. If the work complies, the municipality or\ncounty issues a certificate of occupancy which officially clears the property for\noccupation and use.\nPublic acquisition\nand ownership If efforts to regulate privately owned property are inadequate or impractical\nin a particular situation, or if there is a compelling public need, a county or\nlocal government may acquire property by means of direct purchase.\nChapter 8: Land Use Planning and Control 109",

However, if the private party is\nunwilling to sell, the government may purchase the property anyway. The power\nto do this is called eminent domain.\nEminent domain. Eminent domain allows a government entity to purchase a fee,\nleasehold, or easement interest in privately owned real property for the public\ngood and for public use, regardless of the owner's desire to sell or otherwise\ntransfer any interest. In exchange for the interest, the government must pay the\nowner \"just compensation.\"\nTo acquire a property, the public entity initiates a condemnation suit. Transfer of\ntitle extinguishes all existing leases, liens, and other encumbrances on the\nproperty. Tenants affected by the condemnation sale may or may not receive\ncompensation, depending on the terms of their agreement with the landlord.\nPublic entities that have the power of eminent domain include:\n\uf034 all levels of government\n\uf034 public districts (schools, etc.)\n\uf034 public utilities\n\uf034 public service corporations (power companies, etc.)\n\uf034 public housing and redevelopment agencies\n\uf034 other government agencies\nTo acquire a property, the public entity must first adopt a formal resolution to\nacquire the property, variously called a \u201cresolution of necessity.\u201d The resolution\nmust be adopted at a formal hearing where the owner may voice an opinion. Once\nadopted, the government agency may commence a condemnation suit in court.\nSubsequently, the property is purchased and the title is transferred in exchange for\njust compensation. Transfer of title extinguishes all existing leases, liens, and\nother encumbrances on the property. Tenants affected by the condemnation sale\nmay or may not receive compensation, depending on the terms of their agreement\nwith the landlord.\nIn order to proceed with condemnation, the government agency must demonstrate\nthat the project is necessary, the property is necessary for the project, and that the\nlocation offers the greatest public benefit with the least detriment.\nAs an eminent domain proceeding is generally an involuntary acquisition, the\ncondemnation proceeding must accord with due process of law to ensure that it\ndoes not violate individual property rights. Further, the public entity must justify\nits use of eminent domain in court by demonstrating the validity of the intended\npublic use and the resulting \u201cpublic good\u201d or \u201cpublic purpose\u201d ultimately served.\n110 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The issue of eminent domain versus individual property rights has recently come\nunder scrutiny in light of a 2005 Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the rights of\nstate and local governments to use the power of eminent domain for urban re-\ndevelopment and revitalization. The ruling allowed that private parties could\nundertake a project for profit without any public guarantee that the project would\nbe satisfactorily completed. The ruling brought the issue of \u201cpublic use\u201d into\nquestion, as the use of the re-development could well be private and even a\nprivate for-profit enterprise. The winning argument was that the \u201cpublic purpose\u201d\nis served when redevelopment creates much needed jobs in a depressed urban\narea. As a result of this decision, many see the power of eminent domain and the\ndefinition of public good as being in conflict with the constitutional rights of\nprivate property ownership. New and different interpretations of the public\u2019s\nright to pre-empt private property ownership by eminent domain may be\nexpected.\nPRIVATE LAND USE CONTROL\nDeed restriction\nDeclaration restriction\nDeed condition\nHOA regulation\nProperty owners in the private sector can regulate land use to some extent\nthrough deed restrictions and deed conditions.\nDeed restriction A restriction expressed in a conveyance (deed or lease) of a residential,\ncommercial, or industrial property places limits on the use of the property. Such\nrestrictions are also referred to as \"covenants, conditions, and restrictions,\" or\nCCRs. A quitclaim deed can terminate a private deed restriction.\nTypical restrictions concern:\n\uf034 required minimum area of a residence\n\uf034 setback\n\uf034 prohibition against construction of sheds or secondary buildings\n\uf034 prohibition against conducting certain commercial activities\nDeed restrictions may not be discriminatory by restricting ownership or use on\nthe basis of race, religion, marital status, or gender.\nRestrictions on commercial property use may not violate fair trade and anti-trust\nlaws.\nDeclaration\nrestriction The declaration of a subdivision, Planned Unit Development, condominium, and\ncommercial or industrial park contains private use restrictions. These have the\nsame legal effect as a deed restriction, as the declaration attaches to the rights in\nthe property. A private party cannot, however, extinguish a declaration\nrestriction by agreement or quitclaim deed.\nChapter 8: Land Use Planning and Control 111",

A private usage restriction can be enforced by filing for a court\ninjunction. A court can order the violator to cease and desist, or to correct the\ninfraction. If, however, owners in a subdivision or park allow a violation to\ncontinue for a sufficient length of time, they can lose their right to legal recourse.\nDeed condition A deed condition may restrict certain uses of a property, much like a deed\nrestriction. However, violation of a deed condition gives the grantor the right to\nre- take possession of the property and file suit for legal title.\nHOA regulation Homeowners\u2019 associations (HOAs) are bodies, usually established by\ndevelopers, that determine rules and regulations for the operation of a housing\ndevelopment. The rules are presented in a Declaration of Covenants,\nConditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs) for the development and in association\nby-laws.

With today\u2019s construction methods creating airtight, energy-efficient\nstructures, attention to sources of indoor air pollution is more important than\never. Off-gassing from synthetic materials and lack of ventilation can lead to\nsuch consequences as Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) and Building-Related\nIllness (BRI) as well as other health problems. Among the significant threats are:\n\uf034 asbestos, a powdery mineral once commonly used as a fireproof insulating\nmaterial around pipes, in floor tiles and linoleum, in siding and roofing, in\nwallboard, joint compound, and many other applications.\nWhen airborne, it is a health hazard. Its use today is highly restricted,\nand removal can be expensive and dangerous.

Home and commercial detection devices are\navailable.\n\uf034 formaldehyde, a chemical used in building materials and in other items\nsuch as fabrics and carpeting. As it ages, formaldehyde gives off a\ncolorless, pungent gas.\nIts use in urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) was banned 1982\n(ban later reduced to a warning) but the material is still present in many\nstructures.

It\nhas been banned in paint since 1978 and in new plumbing since 1988.\nIt continues to be a health threat, particularly to children, as it occurs in\nairborne paint particles, paint chips, and soil and groundwater polluted by\nvarious external sources of emission. Inspection should be performed by\nlicensed lead inspectors.\n\uf034 mold, a fungus that grows in the presence of moisture and oxygen on\nvirtually any kind of organic surface.\nIt often destroys the material it grows on and emits toxic irritants into the\nair. Tightly sealed structures with inadequate ventilation are most\nsusceptible. Roof leaks, improper venting of appliances, runoff from gutters\nand downspouts, and flood damage are common contributors. In recent\nyears, mold- and mildew-related lawsuits and claims have become\nsubstantial.\n\uf034 radon, a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas that occurs naturally in the soil\nthroughout the United States.\nIt enters buildings through foundation and floor cracks, wall seams, sump\npits, and windows, among other ways.

States in the Midwest and West predominantly use the rectangular\nsurvey system. Some states combine methods.\nMETES AND BOUNDS\nA metes and bounds description identifies the boundaries of a parcel of real estate\nusing reference points, distances, and angles. The description always identifies an\nenclosed area by starting at an origination point, called point of beginning, or\nPOB, and returning to the POB at the end of the description. A metes and bounds\ndescription must return to the POB in order to be valid.\nThe term \"metes\" refers to distance and direction, and the term \"bounds\"\nrefers to fixed reference points, or monuments and landmarks, which may\nbe natural and artificial. Natural landmarks include trees, rocks, rivers, and\nlakes. Artificial landmarks are typically surveyor stakes.\nMany states use metes and bounds description to describe properties within\nthe rectangular survey system.\nA metes and bounds description begins with an identification of the city, county,\nand state where the property is located. Next, it identifies the POB and describes\nthe distance and direction from the POB to the first monument, and then to\nsubsequent monuments that define the property's enclosed perimeter.\nChapter 9: Legal Descriptions 121",

The system was further modified to facilitate the transfer of large\nquantities of government-owned western lands to private parties.\nTo institute the system, all affected land was surveyed using latitude (east-west)\nand longitude (north-south) lines. The object was to create uniform grids of\nsquares, called townships, which would have equal size and be given a numerical\nreference for identification.\nExhibit 9.2 Principal Meridians and Base Parallels\nThe rectangular survey system works well for describing properties that are\nsquare or rectangular in shape, since these can be described as fractions of\nsections.

The entire subdivision is surveyed to\nspecify the size and location of each lot and block. The surveyor then\nincorporates the survey data into a plat of survey, or subdivision plat map,\nwhich must comply with local surveying standards and ordinances.\nIf local authorities accept it, the subdivision plat map is recorded in the county\nwhere the subdivision is located.

Sale and\nlease contracts and option agreements are used to transfer real estate interests\nfrom one party to another. Mortgage contracts and promissory agreements are\npart of financing real estate. Listing and representation contracts establish\nclient relationships and provide for compensation.\nIn order to work with real estate contracts, it is imperative first to grasp basic\nconcepts that apply to all contracts in general. These concepts provide a\nfoundation for understanding the specifics of particular types of real estate\ncontract.\nCONTRACT VALIDITY\nAND ENFORCEABILITY\nLegal status of contracts\nCriteria for validity\nValidity of a conveyance contract\nEnforcement limitations\nElectronic contracting\nA contract is an agreement between two or more parties who, in a \"meeting\nof the minds,\" have pledged to perform or refrain from performing some act.\nA valid contract is one that is legally enforceable by virtue of meeting certain\nrequirements of contract law. If a contract does not meet the requirements, it\nis not valid and the parties to it cannot resort to a court of law to enforce its\nprovisions.\nNote that a contract is not a legal form or a prescribed set of words in a\ndocument, but rather the intangible agreement that was made in \"the meeting\nof the minds\" of the parties to the contract.\nLegal status\nof contracts In terms of validity and enforceability, a court may construe the legal status of a\ncontract in one of four ways:\n\uf034 valid\n\uf034 valid but unenforceable\n\uf034 void\n\uf034 voidable\nValid. A valid contract is one which meets the legal requirements for\nvalidity. These requirements are explained in the next section.\n130 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

State laws declare that some contracts are enforceable\nonly if they are in writing. These laws apply in particular to the transfer of\ninterests in real estate. Thus, while an oral contract may meet the tests for\nvalidity, if it falls under the laws requiring a written contract, the parties will not\nhave legal recourse to enforce performance. An oral long-term lease and an oral\nreal estate sales contract are examples of contracts that may be valid but not\nenforceable.\nNote that such contracts, if valid, remain so even though not enforceable.\nThis means that if the parties fully execute and perform the contract, the\noutcome may not be altered.\nVoid. A void contract is an agreement that does not meet the tests for validity,\nand therefore is no contract at all. If a contract is void, neither party can enforce\nit.\nFor example, a contract that does not include consideration is void. Likewise,\na contract to extort money from a business is void. Void contracts and\ninstruments are also described as \"null and void.\"\nVoidable. A voidable contract is one which initially appears to be valid, but is\nsubject to rescission by a party to the contract who is deemed to have acted\nunder some kind of disability. Only the party who claims the disability may\nrescind the legal effect of the contract.\nFor example, a party who was the victim of duress, coercion, or fraud in\ncreation of a contract, and can prove it, may disaffirm the contract. However,\nthe disaffirmation must occur within a legal time frame for the act of rescission\nto be valid. Similarly, if the party who has cause to disaffirm the contract\nelects instead to perform it, the contract is no longer voidable but valid.\nA voidable contract differs from a void contract in that the latter does not require\nan act of disaffirmation to render it unenforceable.\nChapter 10 Fundamentals of Contract Law 131",

The parties to a contract must have the capacity to\ncontract, and there must be at least two such parties. Thus, the owner of a\ntenancy for life cannot deed his interest to himself in the form of a fee simple,\nas this would involve only one party. Capacity to contract is determined by\nthree factors:\n\uf034 legal age\n\uf034 mental competency\n\uf034 legitimate authority\nDepending on state law, a contract involving a minor as a party may be either\nvoid or voidable. If the law allows a minor to contract, the contract will\ngenerally be voidable and the minor can disaffirm the contract.\nTo be mentally competent, a party must have sufficient understanding of the\nimport and consequences of a contract. Competency in this context is separate\nand distinct from sanity. Incompetent parties, or parties of \"unsound mind,\"\nmay not enter into enforceable contracts. The incompetency of a party may be\nruled by a court of law or by other means. In some areas, convicted felons may\nbe deemed incompetent, depending on the nature of the crime.\nDuring the period of one's incompetency, a court may appoint a guardian who\nmay act on the incompetent party's behalf with court approval.\nIf the contracting party is representing another person or business entity, the\nrepresentative must have the legal authority to contract.

If the contracting entity is a general partnership, any\npartner may validly contract for the partnership. In a limited partnership, only\ngeneral partners may be parties to a contract.\nMutual consent. Mutual consent, also known as offer and acceptance and\nmeeting of the minds, requires that a contract involve a clear and definite offer\nand an intentional, unqualified acceptance of the offer. In effect, the parties must\nagree to the terms without equivocation. A court may nullify a contract where\nthe acceptance of terms by either party was partial, accidental, or vague.\nValuable consideration. A contract must contain a two-way exchange of\nvaluable consideration as compensation for performance by the other party. The\nexchange of considerations must be two-way. The contract is not valid or\nenforceable if just one party provides consideration.\nValuable consideration can be something of tangible value, such as money or\nsomething a party promises to do or not do. For example, a home builder may\npromise to build a house for a party as consideration for receiving money from\nthe home buyer. Or, a landowner may agree not to sell a property as\nconsideration for a developer's option money. Also, valuable consideration can\nbe something intangible that a party must give up, such as a homeowner's\noccupancy of the house in exchange for rent. In effect, consideration is the price\none party must pay to obtain performance from the other party.\nValuable consideration may be contrasted with good consideration, or \"love and\naffection,\" which does not qualify as consideration in a valid contract. Good\nconsideration is something of questionable value, such as a child's love for her\nmother. Good consideration disqualifies a contract because, while one's love or\naffection is certainly valuable to the other party, it is not something that is\nspecifically offered in exchange for something else. Good consideration can,\nhowever, serve as a nominal consideration in transferring a real property interest\nas a gift.\nIn some cases, what is promised as valuable consideration must also be deemed\nto be sufficient consideration. Grossly insufficient consideration, such as\n$50,000 for a $2 million property, may invalidate a contract on the grounds that\nthe agreement is a gift rather than a contract. In other cases where there is an\nextreme imbalance in the considerations exchanged, a contract may be\ninvalidated as a violation of good faith bargaining.\nChapter 10 Fundamentals of Contract Law 133",

In the absence of a\nstated time period, the offeree has a \"reasonable\" time to accept an offer.\nAcceptance. An offer gives the offeree the power of accepting. For an\nacceptance to be valid, the offeree must manifestly and unequivocally accept\nall terms of the offer without change, and so indicate by signing the offer,\npreferably with a date of signing. The acceptance must then be communicated\nto the offeror. If the communication of acceptance is by mail, the offer is\nconsidered to be communicated as soon as it is placed in the mail.\nCounteroffer By changing any of the terms of an offer, the offeree creates a counteroffer,\nand the original offer is void.

The revocation extinguishes the offer and the\nofferee's right to accept it.\nFor example, a buyer has offered to purchase a house for the listed price. Three\nhours later, a family death radically changes the buyer's plans. She\nimmediately calls the seller and revokes the offer, stating she is no longer\ninterested in the house. Since the seller had not communicated acceptance of\nthe offer to the buyer, the offer is legally cancelled.\nIf the offeree has paid consideration to the offeror to leave an offer open,\nand the offeror accepts, an option has been created which cancels the\nofferor's right to revoke the offer over the period of the option.\nTermination of\nan offer Any of the following actions or circumstances can terminate an offer:\n\uf034 acceptance: the offeree accepts the offer, converting it to a\ncontract\n\uf034 rejection: the offeree rejects the offer\n\uf034 revocation: the offeror withdraws the offer before acceptance\n\uf034 lapse of time: the offer expires\n\uf034 counteroffer: the offeree changes the offer\n\uf034 death or insanity of either party\nAssignment\nof a contract A real estate contract that is not a personal contract for services can be\nassigned to another party unless the terms of the agreement specifically\nprohibit assignment.\nListing agreements, for example, are not assignable, since they are personal\nservice agreements between agent and principal.

Brokers and\nagents may not complete leases, mortgages, contracts for deed, or promissory\nnotes to which they are not a party.\nAgents must be fully aware of what they are legally allowed to do and not do\nin preparing and interpreting contracts for clients.

    "text": "CLASSIFICATIONS OF CONTRACTS\nOral vs. written\nExpress vs. implied\nUnilateral vs. bilateral\nExecuted vs. executory\nOral vs. written A contract may be in writing or it may be an oral, or parol, contract. Certain\noral contracts are valid and enforceable, others are not enforceable, even if\nvalid. For example, most states require listing agreements, sales contracts,\nand leases exceeding one year to be in writing to be enforceable.\nExpress vs. implied An express contract is one in which all the terms and covenants of the\nagreement have been manifestly stated and agreed to by all parties, whether\nverbally or in writing.\nAn implied contract is an unstated or unintentional agreement that may be\ndeemed to exist when the actions of any of the parties suggest the existence of\nan agreement.\nA common example of an implied contract is an implied agency agreement. In\nimplied agency, an agent who does not have a contract with a buyer performs\nacts on the buyer's behalf, such as negotiating a price that is less than the\nlisting price. In so doing, the agent has possibly created an implied contract\nwith the buyer, albeit unintended. If the buyer compensates the agent for the\nnegotiating efforts, the existence of an implied agency agreement becomes\neven less disputable.\nBilateral vs.\nunilateral A bilateral contract is one in which both parties promise to perform their\nrespective parts of an agreement in exchange for performance by the other\nparty.\nAn example of a bilateral contract is an exclusive listing: the broker\npromises to exercise due diligence in the efforts to sell a property, and the\nseller promises to compensate the broker when and if the property sells.\nIn a unilateral contract, only one party promises to do something, provided the\nother party does something. The latter party is not obligated to perform any act,\nbut the promising party must fulfill the promise if the other party chooses to\nperform.\nAn option is an example of a unilateral contract: in an option-to-buy, the party\noffering the option (optionor) promises to sell a property if the optionee\ndecides to exercise the option. While the potential buyer does not have to buy,\nthe owner must sell if the option is exercised.\nExecuted vs.\nexecutory An executed contract is one that has been fully performed and fulfilled:\nneither party bears any further obligation. A completed and expired lease\ncontract is an executed contract: the landlord may re-possess the premises\nand the tenant has no further obligation to pay rent.\n138 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

A\nsales contract prior to closing is executory: while the parties have agreed to buy\nand sell, the buyer has yet to pay the seller and the seller has yet to deed the\nproperty to the buyer.\nCONTRACT TERMINATION\nForms of contract termination\nBreach of contract\nForms of contract\ntermination Termination of a contract, also called cancellation and discharge, may occur for\nany of the following causes.\nPerformance. A contract terminates when fully performed by the parties. It\nmay also terminate for:\n\uf034 partial performance, if the parties agree\n\uf034 sufficient performance, if a court determines a party has\nsufficiently performed the contract, even though not to the\nfull extent of every provision\nInfeasibility. An otherwise valid contract can be canceled if it is not possible\nto perform. Certain personal services contracts, for example, depend on the\nunique capabilities of one person which cannot be substituted by someone\nelse. If such a person dies or is sufficiently disabled, the contract is\ncancelable.\nMutual agreement. Parties to a contract can agree to terminate, or renounce,\nthe contract. If the parties wish to create a new contract to replace the\ncancelled contract, they must comply with the validity requirements for the\nnew contract. Such substitution is called novation.\nCooling-period rescission. Rescission is the act of nullifying a contract. In\nmany states, parties to certain contracts are allowed a statutory amount of time\nafter entering into a contract, or \"cooling period\", to rescind the contract\nwithout cause. No reason need be stated for the cancellation, and the\ncancelling party incurs no liability for performance.\nFor example, consider the unsuspecting buyer of a lot in a new resort\ndevelopment. Such buyers are often the targets of hard-sell tactics which lead\nto a completed sales contract and a deposit. The statutory cooling period\ngives the buyer an opportunity to reconsider the investment in the absence of\nthe persistent salesperson.\nRevocation. Revocation is cancellation of the contract by one party without\nthe consent of the other. For example, a seller may revoke a listing to take the\nproperty off the market. While all parties have the power to revoke, they may\nnot have a defensible right. In the absence of justifiable grounds, a revocation\nmay not relieve the revoking party of contract obligations.\nChapter 10 Fundamentals of Contract Law 139",

    "text": "For example, a seller who revokes a listing without grounds may be required to\npay a commission if the broker found a buyer, or reimburse the broker's\nmarketing expenses if no buyer was found.\nAbandonment. Abandonment occurs when parties fail to perform\ncontract obligations. This situation may allow the parties to cancel the\ncontract.\nLapse of time. If a contract contains an expiration provision and date, the\ncontract automatically expires on the deadline.\nInvalidity of contract. If a contract is void, it terminates without the need\nfor disaffirmation. A voidable contract can be cancelled by operation of\nlaw or by rescission.\nBreach of contract A breach of contract is a failure to perform according to the terms of the\nagreement. Also called default, a breach of contract gives the damaged party\nthe right to take legal action.\nThe damaged party may elect the following legal remedies:\n\uf034 rescission\n\uf034 forfeiture\n\uf034 suit for damages\n\uf034 suit for specific performance\nRescission. A damaged party may rescind the contract. This cancels the\ncontract and returns the parties to their pre-contract condition, including the\nrefunding of any monies already transferred.\nForfeiture. A forfeiture requires the breaching party to give up something,\naccording to the terms of the contract. For example, a buyer who defaults on a\nsales contract may have to forfeit the earnest money deposit.\nSuit for damages. A damaged party may sue for money damages in civil court.\nThe suit must be initiated within the time period allowed by the statute of\nlimitations. When a contract states the total amount due to a damaged party in\nthe event of a breach, the compensation is known as liquidated damages. If the\ncontract does not specify the amount, the damaged party may sue in court for\nunliquidated damages.\nSuit for specific performance. A suit for specific performance is an attempt to\nforce the defaulting party to comply with the terms of the contract. Specific\nperformance suits occur when it is difficult to identify damages because of the\nunique circumstances of the real property in question. The most common\ninstance is a defaulted sale or lease contract where the buyer or seller wants the\ncourt to compel the defaulting party to go through with the transaction, even\nwhen the defaulter would prefer to pay a damage award.\n140 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The parties to the relationship are\nthe principal (a client), the agent (a broker), and the customer ( a third\nparty).\nThe laws of agency are distinct from laws of contracts, although the two\ngroups of laws interact with each other. For example, the listing agreement -- a\ncontract -establishes an agency relationship. Thus the relationship is subject to\ncontract law. However, agency law dictates how the relationship will achieve\nits purposes, regardless of what the listing contract states.\nThe essence of the agency relationship is trust, confidence, and mutual good\nfaith. The principal trusts the agent to exercise the utmost skill and care in\nfulfilling the authorized activity, and to promote the principal's best interests.\nThe agent undertakes to strive in good faith to achieve the desired objective,\nand to fulfill the fiduciary duties.\nIt is important to understand that the agency relationship does not require\ncompensation or any form of consideration. Nor does compensation define\nan agency relationship: a party other than the principal may compensate\nthe agent.\nBasic roles In an agency relationship, a principal hires an agent as a fiduciary to perform a\ndesired service on the principal's behalf. As a fiduciary, the agent has a legal\nobligation to fulfill specific fiduciary duties throughout the term of the\nrelationship.\n142 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The principal, or client, is the party who hires the agent. The agent works for\nthe client. The principal may be a seller, a buyer, a landlord, or a tenant.\nThe agent is the fiduciary of the principal, hired to perform the authorized\nwork and bound to fulfill fiduciary duties. In real estate brokerage the agent\nmust be a licensed broker.\nThe customer or prospect is a third party in the transaction whom the agent does\nnot represent. The agent works with a customer in fulfilling the client's\nobjectives. A seller, buyer, landlord, or tenant may be a customer. A third party\nwho is a potential customer is a prospect.\nTypes of agency According to the level of authority delegated to the agent, there are three types of\nagency: universal, general, and special.\nUniversal agency. In a universal agency relationship, the principal empowers the\nagent to perform any and all actions that may be legally delegated to an agency\nrepresentative. The instrument of authorization is the power of attorney.\nGeneral agency. In a general agency, the principal delegates to the agent\nongoing tasks and duties within a particular business or enterprise. Such\ndelegation may include the authority to enter into contracts.\nSpecial, or limited, agency. Under a special agency agreement, the principal\ndelegates authority to conduct a specific activity, after which the agency\nrelationship terminates. In most cases, the special agent may not bind the\nprincipal to a contract.\nIn most instances, real estate brokerage is based on a special agency. The\nprincipal hires a licensed broker to procure a ready, willing, and able buyer or\nseller. When the objective is achieved, the relationship terminates, although\ncertain fiduciary duties survive the relationship.\nCreating an\nagency relationship An agency relationship may arise from an express oral or written agreement\nbetween the principal and the agent, or from the actions of the parties by\nimplication.\nWritten or oral listing agreement. The most common way of creating an\nagency relationship is by listing agreement, which may be oral or written. The\nagreement sets forth the various authorizations and duties, as well as\nrequirements for compensation. A listing agreement establishes an agency for a\nspecified transaction and has a stated expiration.\nImplied agency. An agency relationship can arise by implication, intentionally or\nunintentionally. Implication means that the parties act as if there were an\nagreement. For example, if an agent promises a buyer to do everything possible\nto find a property at the lowest possible price, and the buyer accepts the\nproposition, there may be an implied agency relationship even though there is no\nspecific agreement. Even if the agent does not wish to establish an agency\nrelationship, the agent's actions may be construed to imply a relationship.\nChapter 11 National Agency 143",

    "text": "Whether intended or accidental, the creation of implied agency obligates the\nagent to fiduciary duties and professional standards of care. If these are not\nfulfilled, the agent may be held liable\nTerminating an\nagency relationship Full performance of all obligations by the parties terminates an agency\nrelationship. In addition, the parties may terminate the relationship at any time\nby mutual agreement. Thirdly, the agency relationship automatically\nterminates on the expiration date, whether the obligations were performed or\nnot.\nInvoluntary termination. An agency relationship may terminate contrary to\nthe wishes of the parties by reason of:\n\uf034 death or incapacity of either party\n\uf034 abandonment by the agent\n\uf034 condemnation or destruction of the property\n\uf034 renunciation\n\uf034 breach\n\uf034 bankruptcy\n\uf034 revocation of the agent's license\nInvoluntary termination of the relationship may create legal and financial\nliability for a party who defaults or cancels. For example, a client may\nrenounce an agreement but then be held liable for the agent's expenses or\ncommission.\nFIDUCIARY DUTIES\nAgent's duties to the client\nAgent's duties to the customer\nPrincipal's duties\nBreach of duty\nThe agency relationship imposes fiduciary duties on the client and agent, but\nparticularly on the agent. An agent must also observe certain standards of\nconduct in dealing with customers and other outside parties.\nAgent's duties\nto the client Skill, care, and diligence. The agent is hired to do a job, and is therefore\nexpected to do it with diligence and reasonable competence. Competence is\ngenerally defined as a level of real estate marketing skills and knowledge\ncomparable to those of other practitioners in the area.\nThe notion of care extends to observing the limited scope of authority granted\nto the agent. A conventional listing agreement does not authorize an agent to\nobligate the client to contracts, and it does not allow the agent to conceal\noffers to buy, sell, or lease coming from a customer or another agent. Further,\nsince a client relies on a broker's representations, a broker must exercise care\nnot to offer advice outside of his or her field of expertise. Violations of this\nstandard may expose the agent to liability for the unlicensed practice of a\nprofession such as law, engineering, or accounting.\n144 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Agent's duties\nto the customer The traditional notion of caveat emptor-- let the buyer beware-- no longer applies\nunequivocally to real estate transactions. Agents do have certain obligations to\ncustomers, even though they do not represent them. In general, they owe a third\nparty:\n\uf034 honesty and fair dealing\n\uf034 reasonable care and skill\n\uf034 proper disclosure\nAn agent has a duty to deal fairly and honestly with a customer. Thus, an agent\nmay not deceive, defraud, or otherwise take advantage of a customer.\n\"Reasonable care and skill\" means that an agent will be held to the standards of\nknowledge, expertise, and ethics that are commonly maintained by other agents\nin the area.\nProper disclosure primarily concerns disclosure of agency, property condition,\nand environmental hazards.\nAn agent who fails to live up to prevailing standards may be held liable for\nnegligence, fraud, or violation of state real estate license laws and regulations.\nAgents should be particularly careful about misrepresenting and offering\ninappropriate expert advice when working with customers.\nIntentional misrepresentation. An agent may intentionally or unintentionally\ndefraud a buyer by misrepresenting or concealing facts. While it is acceptable to\npromote the features of a property to a buyer or the virtues of a buyer to a seller,\nit is a fine line that divides promotion from misrepresentation. Silent\nmisrepresentation, which is intentionally failing to reveal a material fact, is just as\nfraudulent as a false statement.\nNegligent misrepresentation. An agent can be held liable for failure to disclose\nfacts the agent was not aware of if it can be demonstrated that the agent should\nhave known such facts. For example, if it is a common standard that agents\ninspect property, then an agent can be held liable for failing to disclose a leaky\nroof that was not inspected.\nMisrepresentation of expertise. An agent should not act or speak outside the\nagent's area of expertise. A customer may rely on anything an agent says, and the\nagent will be held accountable. For example, an agent represents that a property\nwill appreciate. The buyer interprets this as expert investment advice and buys\nthe property. If the property does not appreciate, the buyer may hold the agent\nliable.\nPrincipal's\nduties The obligations of a principal in an agency relationship concern the following:\nAvailability. In a special agency, the power and decision-making authority of the\nagent are limited. Therefore, the principal must be available for consultation,\ndirection, and decision-making. Otherwise the agent cannot complete the job.\nChapter 11 National Agency 147",

As indicated earlier, however, the agency relationship\ndoes not necessarily include compensation.\nBreach of duty An agent is liable for a breach of duty to client or customer. Since clients and\ncustomers rely on the expertise and actions of agents performing within the\nscope of their authority, regulatory agencies and courts aggressively enforce\nagency laws, standards, and regulations.\nA breach of duty may result in:\n\uf034 rescission of the listing agreement (causing a loss of a\npotential commission)\n\uf034 forfeiture of any compensation that may have already been earned\n\uf034 disciplinary action by state license law authorities, including\nlicense suspension or revocation\n\uf034 suit for damages in court\nFORMS OF REAL ESTATE AGENCY\nSingle agency\nSubagency\nDual agency\nDesignated agency\nNo agency\nNo subagency\nThe primary forms of agency relationship between brokers and principals are:\nsingle agency, dual agency, and subagency.

In this relationship, the property buyer or tenant is the client and\nthe property owner is the customer.\nReal estate vernacular calls an agent of the seller or owner the listing broker. An\nagent who works for the listing broker and who obtained the listing is the listing\nagent. A broker who represents a buyer is the buyer's broker. One who does\nthis as a specialization is a buyer broker. A broker or salesperson who\nrepresents tenants is a tenant representative.\nSubagency In a subagency, a broker or licensed salesperson works as the agent of a broker\nwho is the agent of a client. Subagents might include a cooperating licensed\nbroker, that broker's licensed salespeople, and the listing broker's licensed\nsalespeople, all of whom agree to work for the listing broker on behalf of the\nclient.

The agent\nrepresents both buyer and seller or tenant and owner. For instance, if a\nsalesperson completes a buyer agency agreement with a party on behalf of a\nbroker, and the party then becomes interested in a property listed by the broker,\nthe broker becomes a dual agent.\nDual agency has become increasingly prevalent with the advent of buyer and\ntenant representation. Dual agency may arise from voluntary, specific agreement\nbetween the principal parties or from the parties' actions, much like implied\nsingle agency.\nConflict of interest. Dual agency contains an inherent conflict of interest.\nSince many of an agent's fiduciary duties can only be rendered to one party,\ndual agency is, by definition, difficult, if not impossible.\nWritten, informed consent. In states that permit dual agency, the agent must\nmeet strict disclosure requirements, and principals must agree in writing to\nproceed with the dual agency relationship.\nDisclosed (voluntary) dual agency. The parties to a transaction may create a\ndual agency by giving written consent in disclosure forms, confirmation forms,\nand sale contract forms. For example, an agent represents a buyer who becomes\ninterested in a property that the agent has listed with the seller. The agent then\ndiscloses the relationship with the principals to both principals, and the principals\nagree in writing to move ahead. A disclosed dual agency is thus voluntarily\ncreated.\nImplied and undisclosed dual agency. If a broker or agent acts in any way\nthat leads a customer to believe that the agent is representing the customer, a\ndual agency has potentially been created. For example, a buyer makes\nconfidential disclosures to the agent who works for the seller and exhorts the\nagent to keep them confidential. The buyer wants the house but knows he is\ngoing to lose his job in a month and probably will not qualify for financing. If\nthe agent agrees to keep the information confidential, the agent has not only\ncreated an agency relationship with the buyer, but is now in a dual agency\nsituation. Moreover, if the agent fails to disclose the buyer's confidence to the\nseller, the agent has violated fiduciary duty to the seller.\nDuties of a disclosed dual agent. A dual agent's first duty is to disclose the\nagency relationship to both principal parties or to withdraw from one side of the\nduality. After disclosing, the agent must obtain the written consent of both\nparties.\n150 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The designated agency\nagreement allows a broker to select a salesperson and associate brokers to act as\nthe client\u2019s agent.\nA designated agency agreement must contain the name of all associate brokers\nwho are authorized to act as supervisory brokers.

A designated agent cannot disclose a client\u2019s confidential information to\nany licensee, whether or not an affiliated licensee, except that a designated agent\nmay disclose to any supervisory broker confidential information of a client for\npurposes of seeking advice or assistance for the benefit of the client.

For example, one designated\nagent can represent the buyer and another designated agent can represent the\nseller in the same transaction, and neither is a dual agent. The broker and all\nsupervisory brokers are considered disclosed consensual dual agents for that real\nestate transaction.

A recent solution\nallows a broker to represent no one in a transaction. That is, the broker acts as a\ntransaction broker, or facilitator, and is not an agent of either the buyer or\nseller. In this relationship, the facilitator does not advocate the interests of either\nparty.\nDuties of the transaction broker, or facilitator. In the role of transaction\nbroker, the broker's duties and standards of conduct are to\n\uf034 account for all money and property received or handled\n\uf034 exercise reasonable skill and care\n\uf034 provide honesty and fair dealing\n\uf034 present all offers in a timely fashion\n\uf034 assist the parties in closing the transaction\n\uf034 keep the parties fully informed\n\uf034 advise the parties to obtain expert advice or counsel\n\uf034 disclose to both parties in residential sale transactions all material\nfacts affecting the property's value\n\uf034 protect the confidences of both parties in matters that would\nmaterially disadvantage one party over the other.\n152 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Since there are no fiduciary\nduties binding the transaction broker, the broker is held to standards for dealing\nwith customers as opposed to clients. These include honesty, fair dealing, and\nreasonable care. The transaction broker is under no obligation to inspect the\nproperty for the benefit of a party or verify the accuracy of statements made by a\nparty.\nAs state regulatory authorities formalize the facilitator role, it is expected that\nbrokers will have to obtain written consent from the principal parties, just as in\nthe case of dual agency.\nNo subagency As another response to the problem of \u2018who works for whom,\u2019 some states have\nrecently moved in the direction of disallowing subagency. In this scenario,\nsubagency is replaced by buyer agency and seller agency only. In other words, an\nagent either represents the buyer directly, or the seller directly. An agent who\nshows a buyer a property either represents the buyer, or is in fact the listing\nagent. Note that this arrangement need not change traditional compensation\nstructures: an agent may represent a buyer and still receive a portion of the\ncommission paid by the seller.\nAGENCY DISCLOSURE RULES\nObjectives of disclosure\nSeller agent disclosures\nBuyer agent disclosures\nDual agent disclosures\nFacilitator disclosures\nTraditionally, brokers and agents have disclosed to customers whose interests it is\nthat they are serving. This traditional ethic is now, in many states, required by\nlaw.

It may prevent\ncomplaints arising from customers and clients who feel they have been deceived.\nSpecifically, the requirement to disclose aims to:\n\uf034 notify clients and customers about whom the agent represents\n\uf034 inform clients and customers of the fiduciary duties and standards\nof care the agent owes them\n\uf034 inform prospective clients and customers that they have a choice\nin how they are represented\n\uf034 obtain acknowledgement and acceptance of the disclosure from\nthe principal parties\nRecent legislation requires an agent to disclose to all parties the fact that the\nagent represents one party and does not represent the other.

    "text": "12\nListing Agreements: An\n12\nOverview\nReview of Legal Foundations\nTypes of Listing Agreement\nFulfillment and Termination\nAgreement Clauses\nREVIEW OF LEGAL FOUNDATIONS\nAgency law\nContract law\nA listing agreement, the document that puts an agent or broker in business, is a\nlegally enforceable real estate agency agreement between a real estate broker and\na client, authorizing the broker to perform a stated service for compensation. The\nunique characteristic of a listing agreement is that it is governed both by agency\nlaw and by contract law.\nAgency law The cornerstones of agency law in the context of a listing agreement are:\n\uf034 definition of the roles of parties involved\n\uf034 fiduciary duties of the agent\n\uf034 agent's scope of authority\nParties. The principal parties to the contract are the listing broker and the client.\nThe client may be buyer, seller, landlord or tenant in the proposed transaction.\nLegally, the broker is the client's agent. The principal party on the other side of\nthe transaction is a customer or a potential customer, called a prospect. A broker\nor salesperson who assists the listing broker in finding a customer is an agent of\nthe listing broker and a subagent of the client. A broker who represents the party\non the other side of the transaction is an agent of that party, and not an agent of\nthe listing broker, unless a dual agency arrangement is specifically allowed.\nFiduciary duties. A listing agreement establishes an agency relationship between\nagent and client that commits the agent to the full complement of fiduciary duties\nto the client in fulfilling the agreement.\nScope of authority. Customarily, a listing is a special agency, or limited agency,\nagreement. Special agency limits the scope of the broker's authority to specific\nactivities, generally those which generate customers and catalyze the transaction.\nA special agency agreement usually does not authorize a broker to obligate the\nclient to a contract as a principal party, unless the agreement expressly grants\nsuch authorization or the client has granted power of attorney to the broker. For\nexample, a listing broker may not tell a buyer that the seller will accept an offer\nChapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 157",

    "text": "regardless of its terms. Telling the offeror that the offer is accepted would be an\neven more serious breach of the agreement.\nUnder agency law, a client is liable for actions the broker performs that are\nwithin the scope of authority granted by the listing agreement. A client is not\nliable for acts of the broker which go beyond the stated or implied scope of\nauthority.\nThus, in the previous example, the seller would not be liable for the broker's\nstatements that the offer would be accepted or was accepted, since the broker did\nnot have the authority to make such statements. A broker who exceeds the scope\nof authority in the listing agreement risks forfeiting compensation and perhaps\neven greater liabilities.\nContract law Bilateral or unilateral agreement. Listings may be bilateral or unilateral,\ndepending on the type of listing and the wording of the agreement. An open\nlisting is a unilateral agreement in that the seller promises to pay a commission to\nany agent who produces a buyer but no agent promises or is obligated to take any\naction. On the other hand, most exclusive listings are bilateral agreements\nbecause of wording that promises the due diligence of the agent to procure a\nbuyer in return for the seller\u2019s promise to pay a commission if a buyer is\nproduced.\nValidity. A listing agreement must meet the requirements for a valid contract to\nbe enforceable.\nTermination. A listing, like any contract, may terminate for any of the following\ncauses: performance, infeasibility, mutual agreement, rescission, revocation,\nabandonment, lapse of time, invalidity, and breach.\nLegal form. A valid listing may be oral or written. However, many states\nconsider only a written listing to be enforceable, particularly an exclusive right-\nto-sell listing. In practice, a broker should get every listing in writing and make\nsure it clearly states what the broker is authorized to do and how the broker will\nbe paid. An oral listing, even if enforceable, limits a broker's ability to remedy\nproblems:\n\uf034 a contested oral listing must be supported by considerable evidence\nto be enforced\n\uf034 a broker may not be able to sue a principal for damages incurred\nunder an oral lease\n\uf034 if the client dies, the broker may not be able to obtain\ncompensation for a successfully performed oral listing\nAn express listing, verbal or written, manifestly authorizes the broker to pursue\ncertain actions for the client. Clients and agents may also create an implied\nagency listing based on substantive actions rather than on an express agreement.\nFor example, if a seller allows a broker to undertake certain activities toward\neffecting a transaction without a specific authorization, but with full knowledge\nand consent, an implied agency may have been created. Consequently, if the\nprincipal proceeds with a customer procured in this manner, he or she may be\n158 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Since a listing agreement is a personal service contract, it is not\nassignable. In particular, a broker cannot assign a listing to another broker.\nTYPES OF LISTING AGREEMENT\nExclusive right-to-sell (or lease)\nExclusive agency\nOpen listing\nNet listing\nBuyer and tenant agency agreement\nTransaction broker agreement\nMultiple listing\nLimited services agreement\nA broker may represent any principal party of a transaction: seller, landlord,\nbuyer, tenant. An owner listing authorizes a broker to represent an owner or\nlandlord. There are three main types of owner listing agreement: exclusive right-\nto-sell (or lease); exclusive agency; and open listing. Another type of listing,\nrarely used today and illegal in many states, is a net listing. The first three forms\ndiffer in their statement of conditions under which the broker will be paid. The\nnet listing is a variation on how much the broker will be paid.\nA buyer agency or tenant representation agreement authorizes a broker to\nrepresent a buyer or tenant. The most commonly used form is an exclusive right-\nto-represent agreement, the equivalent of an exclusive right-to-sell. However,\nexclusive agency and open types of agreement may be also used to secure a\nrelationship on this side of a transaction.\nThough not a distinct type of listing agreement, multiple listing is a significant\nfeature of brokerage practice. Multiple listing is an authorization to enter a listing\nin a multiple listing service.\nExclusive right-\nto-sell (or lease) The exclusive right-to-sell, also called exclusive authorization-to-sell and,\nsimply, the exclusive, is the most widely used owner agreement. Under the terms\nof this listing, a seller contracts exclusively with a single broker to procure a\nbuyer or effect a sale transaction. If a buyer is procured during the listing period,\nthe broker is entitled to a commission, regardless of who is procuring cause.\nThus, if anyone-the owner, another broker-- sells the property, the owner must\npay the listing broker the contracted commission.\nThe exclusive right-to-lease is a similar contract for a leasing transaction. Under\nthe terms of this listing, the owner or landlord must pay the listing broker a\ncommission if anyone procures a tenant for the named premises.\nThe exclusive listing gives the listing broker the greatest assurance of receiving\ncompensation for marketing efforts.\nChapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 159",

Some states do not require the agreement to\nbe in writing, but if it is in writing, it must have an expiration date.\nExclusive agency An exclusive agency listing authorizes a single broker to sell the property and\nearn a commission, but leaves the owner the right to sell the property without the\nbroker's assistance, in which case no commission is owed. Thus, if any party\nother than the owner is procuring cause in a completed sale of the property,\nincluding another broker, the contracted broker has earned the commission. This\narrangement may also be used in a leasing transaction: if any party other than the\nowner procures the tenant, the owner must compensate the listing broker.\nAn exclusive agency listing generally must have an expiration date. Most states\nallow either an oral or written agreement.\nOpen listing An open listing, or, simply, open, is a non-exclusive authorization to sell or lease\na property. The owner may offer such agreements to any number of brokers in\nthe marketplace. With an open listing, the broker who is the first to perform\nunder the terms of the listing is the sole party entitled to a commission.\nPerformance usually consists of being the procuring cause in the finding of a\nready, willing, and able customer. If the transaction occurs without a procuring\nbroker, no commissions are payable.\nOpen listings are rare in residential brokerage. Brokers generally shy away from\nthem because they offer no assurance of compensation for marketing efforts. In\naddition, open listings cause commission disputes. To avoid such disputes, a\nbroker has to register prospects with the owner to provide evidence of procuring\ncause in case a transaction results.\nAn open listing may be oral or written.\nNet listing A net listing is one in which an owner sets a minimum acceptable amount to be\nreceived from the transaction and allows the broker to have any amount received\nin excess as a commission, assuming the broker has earned a commission\naccording to the other terms of the agreement. The owner's \"net\" may or may not\naccount for closing costs.\nFor example, a seller requires $750,000 for a property. A broker sells the\nproperty for $830,000 and receives the difference, $80,000, as commission.\nNet listings are generally regarded as unprofessional today, and many states have\noutlawed them. The argument against the net listing is that it creates a conflict of\ninterest for the broker. It is in the broker's interest to encourage the owner to put\nthe lowest possible acceptable price in the listing, regardless of market value.\nThus the agent violates fiduciary duty by failing to place the client's interests\nabove those of the agent.\n160 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Thus:\n\uf034 a representation agreement may be an exclusive, exclusive\nagency, or open listing. As with owner listings, the most widely\nused agreement is the exclusive. In this arrangement, the buyer\nagrees to only work with the buyer representative in procuring a\nproperty.\n\uf034 an exclusive listing generally must have an expiration date along\nwith other requirements of a valid listing.\n\uf034 state laws require an exclusive authorization to be in writing\nDuties of the Agent. At the formation of the relationship, the buyer agent has the\nduty to explain how buyer or tenant agency relationships work. This is\nculminated by a signed agreement where the principal understands and accepts\nthese circumstances. During the listing term, the buyer or tenant agent\u2019s principal\nduties are to diligently locate a property that meets the principal\u2019s requirements.\nIn addition, the agent must comply with his or her state agency-disclosure laws\nwhich may differ from those of traditional listing agents. This involves timely\ndisclosures to prospective sellers and their agents, usually upon initial contact.\nTransaction broker\nagreement In terms of agency, a transaction broker is in a non-agency relationship with the\nseller or buyer. The agent is not bound by fiduciary duties to either party.\nNevertheless, transaction brokers enter into binding agreements with buyers and\nsellers to complete transactions. Such agreements may be exclusive or non-\nexclusive. Like conventional listings, the transaction brokerage agreement binds\nthe principal to a compensation agreement in the event the broker procures a\nproperty or a buyer.

A listing agreement authorizes a broker to undertake\nactions relevant to achieving the performance objective.

Due diligence in the listing context refers to verifying the\naccuracy of the statements in the listing regarding the property, the owner, and\nthe owner's representations. Especially important facts for a broker or agent to\nverify are:\n\uf034 the property condition\n\uf034 ownership status\n\uf034 the client's authority to act\nFailure to perform a reasonable degree of due diligence may increase an agent's\nexposure to liability in the event that the property is not as represented or that the\nclient cannot perform as promised.\nDelegation of responsibilities.

Only the broker can obtain\nand disburse the compensation.\nCompensation The main item of performance for the client is payment of compensation, if the\nagreement calls for it.

    "text": "Procuring cause. Disputes often arise as to whether an agent is owed a\ncommission. Many such disputes involve open listings where numerous agents\nare working to find customers for the principal, and none has a clear claim on a\ncommission. In other cases, a client may claim to have found the customer alone\nand therefore to have no responsibility for paying a commission. There are also\nsituations where cooperating brokers and subagents working under an exclusive\nlisting dispute about which one(s) deserve a share of the listing broker's\ncommission.\nThe concept that decides such disputes is that the party who was the \"procuring\ncause\" in finding the customer is entitled to the commission or commission share.\nThe two principal determinants of procuring cause are:\n\uf034 being first to find the customer\n\uf034 being the one who induces the customer to complete the\ntransaction\nFor example, Broker A and Broker B each have an open listing with a property\nowner. Broker A shows Joe the property on Monday. Broker B shows Joe the\nsame property on Friday, and then Joe buys the property. Broker A will probably\nbe deemed to be the procuring cause by virtue of having first introduced Joe to\nthe property.\nCompensation for buyer brokers. Buyer agency agreements stipulate how the\nagent will be compensated in the relationship. The compensation may be a client-\npaid retainer fee or a commission contingent upon a completed transaction or\nprocured seller. It is common practice for the agent to be paid by the customer to\nthe transaction, the seller, as opposed to the fiduciary principal, the buyer or\ntenant. In addition, the agent may be paid by the buyer in the event that the seller\nor listing agent refuses to offer any compensation to the buyer broker. This might\noccur, for example, in the case of a for-sale-by-owner transaction.\nIn addition to the form of compensation and the parties responsible for paying the\nagent, the buyer agency agreement defines when the compensation is in fact\nearned and will be paid. Customarily, the commission is earned when a sales\ncontract is completed by the transacting parties. The agent may be entitled to\ncompensation even if the buyer defaults on the terms of the sales contract.\nNormally, agents are paid at closing or upon the buyer\u2019s default.\nCauses for\ntermination A listing may terminate on grounds of:\n\uf034 performance: all parties perform; the intended outcome\n\uf034 infeasibility: it is not possible to perform under the terms of the\nagreement\n\uf034 mutual agreement: both parties agree to cancel the listing\n\uf034 revocation: either party cancels the listing, with or without the\nright\n\uf034 abandonment: the broker does not attempt to perform\n\uf034 breach: the terms of the listing are violated\n\uf034 lapse of time: the listing expires\n\uf034 invalidity of contract: the listing does not meet the criteria for\nvalidity\n\uf034 incapacitation or death of either party\n164 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Courts in many states construe any listing\nthat has no expiration as an open listing.

For instance, it may state that a commission is\nearned if a buyer is procured, a contract is executed, or the seller voluntarily\ntransfers the property for any price during the listing period.\nA fee clause usually provides for remedies in the event of default by the buyer or\nseller. In effect, if the seller breaches the listing without grounds after a buyer has\nbeen procured, the commission is payable.

Here the buyer affirms that he or she is\nnot represented by another agent. In addition the buyer acknowledges an\nunderstanding of the agency relationship.\nAgent compensation.

Second, the clause establishes the circumstances under which the\nagent has earned the commission.

The core activity of real estate brokerage is the business\nof procuring a buyer, seller, tenant, or property on behalf of a client for the\npurpose of completing a transaction. If successful, the broker receives a\ncommission according to the provisions of a listing agreement. A broker's\ncompensation for effecting a transaction is usually a negotiated percentage of the\npurchase price.\nBroker cooperation. In most cases, transactions require the assistance of a\ncooperating broker from another brokerage company acting as a subagent. Most\nlisting agreements provide for brokerage cooperation in the multiple listing\nclause. A transaction involving a cooperating subagent is called co-brokerage. In\na co-brokered transaction, the listing broker splits the commission with the \"co-\nbroker,\" typically on a 50-50 basis. A broker may cooperate with other brokers\non either side of a transaction, either assisting a listing agent to locate a buyer or\ntenant, or assisting a buyer or tenant representative in locating a seller or\nlandlord.\nIn the most common form of broker cooperation, an outside broker locates a\nbuyer for the listing broker's seller. In such cases, the listing broker shares the\ncommission with the cooperating \"selling\" broker on a pre-determined basis.\nMultiple listing service (MLS). The second prevalent form of broker\ncooperation is the multiple listing service, or MLS. A multiple listing service is\nan organization of brokers who have agreed to cooperate with member brokers in\nmarketing listings. Members of the service also agree to enter all exclusive\nlistings into the listing distribution network so that every member is promptly\ninformed of new listings as they come on the market.\nThe listing agreement used by members of a multiple listing service discloses\nrelevant procedures and policies so that all principal parties to the agreement are\naware of the pooling of the listing.

The listing agreement sets forth specific duties.\nCritical brokerage skills. To generate business, as well as achieve the\ntransactional objectives of clients, a broker must be proficient in four skill areas:\n\uf034 obtaining a client listing\n\uf034 marketing a listing\n\uf034 facilitating the closing of a transaction\n\uf034 managing market information\nA client hires a broker by executing a listing agreement. Once hired, the broker or\nagent implements a marketing plan to procure the other principal party for the\ntransaction. The broker then plays an important role in pre-closing activities to\nensure successful closing of the transaction.\nTo serve clients and locate customers, a broker must become expert in local real\nestate market conditions. A fundamental part of maintaining market expertise is\norganizing and managing an information system.\nTypes of transactions and properties brokered. Brokers and salespeople are\nlicensed to broker all types of real property for clients in any form of transaction.\nIn practice, it is common for brokers and agents to specialize in a type of\nproperty, a type of transaction, or a geographical area.\nBrokerage vs. trading. The distinction between brokerage and trading for one's\nown account is important for determining whether one must be licensed to\nperform the real estate activity in question. To be considered brokerage, an\nagent's activity must generally be conducted on behalf of a person or business\nentity other than the agent. Buying, selling, and leasing real estate for one's own\naccount or for one's company are generally not considered brokerage.\nBrokerage vs. advisory services. Technically, brokerage is distinct from the\npractice of rendering real estate advisory services. A licensed broker acting as a\nconsultant for a fee usually is not working to effect a particular transaction. Since\nthe objective is not purely transaction-oriented, the activity is not really\nbrokerage. Examples of advisory services include:\n\uf034 providing an estimate of value\n\uf034 performing market analysis\n\uf034 managing property\nEven though fee consulting is not brokerage in the strict sense, real estate\nconsultants who offer advisory services to the public must have a real estate\nlicense in most states.\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 175",

Real estate license laws. All fifty states (and Canada) impose legal licensing\nrequirements on any person or business entity desiring to broker real estate. To\nobtain a broker's license, an applicant must complete required education, meet\nexperience requirements as a salesperson, and pass a state examination.

A sole proprietorship is a business owned by a single\nindividual. When the proprietor dies, the business terminates. Sole\nproprietorships must follow state licensing and registration laws to conduct\nbusiness, such as fictitious name laws. Other distinguishing characteristics of\nsole proprietorships are:\n\uf034 liability: sole proprietors are personally liable for their own debts\nand actions and those of employees while performing business\nduties; proprietors may be sued personally\n176 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Thus a brokerage\nmay represent only commercial tenants, or only residential buyers, or some other\nlimited type of client.\nTrade\norganizations Numerous trade organizations serve the real estate brokerage industry and all of\nits areas of specialization.

State real estate license laws provide for two distinct\nlicenses to conduct real estate brokerage: the broker license and the salesperson or\nsales agent license.\nA licensed real estate broker is duly authorized to represent clients directly in\nbrokering real estate. A sales agent, on the other hand, is only authorized to\nrepresent a broker and carry out such duties as the broker may legitimately\ndelegate. In other words, a sales agent does not directly represent the client in a\ntransaction but is rather the agent of the broker and subagent of the client. A sales\nagent is therefore a fiduciary of the employing broker.\nAs agent of a broker, a salesperson may offer properties for sale or lease, procure\nbuyers, negotiate transaction terms, and otherwise conduct the business of\nbrokerage. The agent, however, must act entirely on the broker's behalf.\n180 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The goal of prospecting is to reach a potential seller or landlord, make that person\naware of the agent's and brokerage's services, and obtain permission to discuss\nthe benefits of listing, often in the form of a formal selling presentation.\nPricing. It is almost always necessary for an agent seeking a listing to suggest a\nlisting price or price range for the property. It is important to make a careful\nestimate, because underpricing a property is not in the best interests of the seller,\nand overpricing it often prevents a transaction altogether.\nThe \"Appraisal\" chapter describes methods of estimating value. In brief, an agent\nusually relies on an analysis of comparable properties which have recently sold in\nthe same neighborhood. By making adjustments for the differences between the\nsubject property and the comparables, the agent arrives at a general price range.\nAgents must be careful to caution sellers that they are not appraisers, and that the\nsuggested price range is not an expert opinion of market value. If a more precise\nestimate of market value is desired, the seller should hire a licensed appraiser.\nListing presentation and negotiation of agreement. A listing presentation is an\nagent's opportunity to meet with a seller and present the merits of the agent's\nmarketing plan, personal expertise, and company strengths. At the same time, an\nagent can explain the many phases and details of a real estate transaction and\npoint out how the provisions of the listing agreement and the agent-principal\nrelationship work to ensure a smooth transaction.\nUltimately, the agent's aim in a presentation meeting is to have the principal\nexecute a listing agreement. The agent must then submit the listing to the broker\nfor approval and signing. This result will set in motion the process of marketing\nthe property. In practice, it may take an agent many meetings with a prospect\nbefore the prospect signs an agreement.\nMarketing listings The process of marketing a listed property occurs in three broad steps, leading to\nthe desired end of a completed sale contract. At each of these steps, there are\ncritical skills an agent must master.\nExhibit 13.5 Marketing Steps\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 185",

    "text": "Marketing plan. After the broker formalizes the listing agreement, the sales\nagent initiates a marketing plan for the property. An ideal marketing plan is a\ncohesive combination of promotional and selling activities directed at potential\ncustomers. The best combination is one that aims to have maximum impact on\nthe marketplace in relation to the time and money expended.\nSelling the prospect. When marketing activities produce prospects, the agent's\nmarketing role becomes more interpersonal. An agent must now:\n\uf034 qualify prospects' plans, preferences, and financial capabilities\n\uf034 show properties that meet the customer's needs\n\uf034 elicit the buyer's reactions to properties\n\uf034 report material results to the seller or listing agent\nAt the earliest appropriate time, an agent must make certain disclosures to a\nprospective customer. Depending on state laws, an agent may have to disclose the\nrelevant agency relationship, the property's physical condition, and the possible\npresence of hazardous materials.\nObtaining offers. If a buyer is interested in purchasing a property, an agent\nobtains the buyer's offer of transaction terms, including price, down payment,\ndesired closing date, and financing requirements.\nAn agent must be extremely careful at this point to abide by fiduciary obligations\nto the client, whoever that party may be. Discussions of price are particularly\ndelicate: whether the client is buyer or seller, the agent's duty is to uphold the\nclient's best interests. Thus it is not acceptable to suggest to a customer what\nprice the client will or will not accept. With pricing and other issues, it is always\na good practice to understand what role the client wants the agent to assume in\nthe offering phase of the transaction; in other words, exactly how far the agent\nmay go in developing terms on the client's behalf.\nWhen a buyer or tenant makes an offer, the agent must present it to the seller or\nlandlord at the earliest possible moment. If the terms of the offer are\nunacceptable, the agent may assist the seller in developing a counteroffer, which\nthe agent would subsequently submit to the customer or customer's agent. The\noffering and counteroffering process continues until a meeting of the minds\nresults in a sale contract.\nPre-closing activities Between the execution of the sale contract and the closing of the transaction, the\nproperty is \"under contract\" or \"contract pending.\" During this period, buyer and\nseller have certain things to do to achieve a successful closing. The buyer often\nneeds to arrange financing and dispose of other property; the seller may need to\nclear up title encumbrances and make certain property repairs. The sale contract\nshould specify all such required tasks.\nThe time period between contracting and closing is referred to as the\ncontingency period, or pre-closing period.\nAgent's responsibilities. As dictated by custom and the circumstances of a\ntransaction, an agent has a range of duties and responsibilities during the pre-\nclosing period.\n186 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Most\nstates impose deadlines for this requirement, usually within twenty-four hours\nfrom the agent's receipt of the deposit.\nOther possible responsibilities are:\n\uf034 assisting the buyer in obtaining financing\n\uf034 assisting the seller in clearing title\n\uf034 assisting the seller in completing property repairs\n\uf034 recommending inspectors, appraisers, attorneys, and title\ncompanies\n\uf034 assisting in communications between principals\n\uf034 assisting in the exchange of transaction documents\nBroker's responsibilities. The listing broker has the primary responsibility for\nhandling deposit monies and for overseeing the agent's pre-closing activities.\nState license laws require that earnest money deposits be placed in an account\nwhich is separate from the broker's operating accounts. They also require the\nbroker to keep accurate records and follow accepted accounting procedures.\nThese precautions protect the buyer and seller and safeguard the deposited funds.\nA broker must be careful to avoid two common violations of escrow regulations:\ncommingling and conversion, described below.\nHandling trust\nfunds General account requirements. Brokers who receive and hold earnest money\ndeposits or money belonging to others, particularly clients and customers, must\nmaintain a trust account. Typically, trust accounts must\n\uf034 designate the real estate broker as trustee\n\uf034 provide for withdrawal of funds without prior notice\nState or national depository institution. According to state law, brokers must\nmaintain their escrow accounts in a state- or federally-chartered savings and loan\nassociation or credit union. A broker may maintain more than one trust account to\nmeet business requirements.\nNon-trust funds. Brokers may maintain nominal amounts of operating funds in\ntheir trust accounts sufficient to cover bank service charges and minimum\nbalance requirements. Such non-trust funds must be identified as such in the trust\naccount.\nCommingling. Commingling is the act of mixing the broker's personal or\nbusiness funds with escrow funds. To avoid committing a violation, a broker\nmust not deposit any money belonging to others in the broker's business or\npersonal account. Also, a broker must not deposit operating funds into any trust\naccount. The definition of commingling includes the failure to deposit earnest\nmoney into escrow in a timely manner. In most states, commingling funds\nconstitutes grounds for license suspension or revocation and is a serious violation\nof the law.\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 187",

    "text": "Conversion. Conversion is the act of misappropriating escrow funds for the\nbroker's business or personal use. More serious than mere commingling,\nconversion is effectively an act of theft: using monies which do not belong to the\nbroker. Conversion carries serious consequences, including license revocation.\nDeposit deadlines. A real estate broker must deposit trust funds received within\na required deadline after receiving notice that an offer to purchase is accepted by\nall parties. The deadline varies from state-to-state, so licensees must be familiar\nwith local regulations to remain in compliance with escrow laws.\nHolding funds. Brokers must retain the trust monies in the trust account until\nthe transaction involved is consummated or terminated, at which time the broker\nmust account for the full amount received and disbursed.\nIf a purchase agreement signed by a seller and purchaser provides for someone\nother than a real estate broker to hold a deposit, a licensee in possession of that\ndeposit must deliver the deposit to that person within the required number of\nbanking days after the licensee receives notice that an offer to purchase is\naccepted by all parties.\nReturn of earnest money deposit. Generally, escrow funds are disbursed to the\nrespective parties at closing, or according to escrow instructions. However, if\nany trust fund disbursement is disputed, the broker must follow very specific\nprocedures for handling the dispute. Depending on the jurisdiction, these can\nrange from arbitration to court-ordered resolutions. In any case, the broker must\nrely on state regulations and legal solutions instituted by the courts.\nSalesperson receiving trust funds. A real estate salesperson must deliver to the\nreal estate broker, on receipt, a deposit or other money paid in connection with a\ntransaction in which the real estate salesperson is engaged on behalf of the real\nestate broker.\nCommunications\nand technology Multiple listing services and websites. The posting and sharing of property\nlistings and data among broker websites, firm websites, and multiple listing\nservices (MLS) is one of the most effective marketing tools available to today\u2019s\nlicensees. Broker cooperation assures sellers of maximum exposure for their\nproperties, just as it assures buyers of seeing the widest possible range of listed\nproperties.\nTo ensure fair use of MLS facilities, the National Association of REALTORS\u00ae\nhas developed an Internet Data Exchange (IDX) policy that enables MLS\nmembers to display and use MLS data while respecting the rights of property\nowners and brokers to market their properties however they want.\nBasically, persons who want to make use of MLS data have to share their own\ndata as well. They can opt out of the sharing policy so that competitors cannot\npost their properties on competing websites, but then they cannot post\ncompetitors\u2019 properties on their own sites.\nThere are a number of websites that provide consumers with the capability to\nsearch through listings all over the country and even the world.

In brief, be truthful,\ndirect, and concise. Provide the information required by law, and do not violate\nprohibitions against unsolicited emails and messages.\nSocial media. Social media websites allow rapid exchange of information,\ndocuments, photos, messages and data with a select group of contacts.

Smartphones facilitate the use, not only of email, texting, and\nsocial media, but also of immediate internet access, document review, photo and\ndocument sharing, data storage, and video conferencing. They offer, in fact, an\nalmost complete mobile office.\nManaging\ninformation The ability to satisfy the needs of clients and customers is largely dependent on a\nbroker's ability to obtain, organize, and manage information. Information is a\ncornerstone of the broker's perceived value in the marketplace and a major reason\nwhy buyers and sellers seek a broker out. Systematic collection and updating of\nrelevant information is therefore a business priority.\nProperty data. Most brokerages maintain two categories of property data:\navailable properties, and all properties in the market area. In residential\nbrokerage, available property basically consists of the listings in the MLS and\nfor-sale-by-owner properties. Records for all properties in an area are accessible\nin tax records. Commercial brokerages usually keep track of available and\noccupied commercial properties in a proprietary database.\nBuyer data. Buyer information is usually compiled and maintained, often\ninformally, by each agent in a brokerage. An agency's base of prospects who are\nlooking for property at any given time is valuable for marketing new listings.\nTenant data. In residential and commercial leasing companies, information is\ncompiled and maintained on all tenants in an area, by property type used. Such\nfiles contain a tenant's lease expiration, property size, and rent.\nClient data. It is important to keep track of both current and former clients.\nFormer clients are likely prospects to become clients again or customers. They\nare also a source of referrals. Current clients, of course, should be the broker's\nprimary concern.\nMarket data. Today's clients and customers expect a broker to know the market\nintimately. It is often the broker or agent with the best market knowledge who\ndominates business in the market. Knowing a market includes keeping up to date\non:\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 189",

Businesses may not collude to fix prices, allocate\nmarkets, create monopolies, or otherwise interfere with free market operations.\nPrice fixing. Price fixing is the practice of two or more brokers agreeing to\ncharge certain commission rates or fees for their services, regardless of market\nconditions or competitors. In essence, such pricing avoids and disturbs the\ndynamics of a free, open market.\nFor instance, the two largest brokerages in a market jointly decide to cut\ncommission rates by 50% in order to draw clients away from competitors. The\ncut-rate pricing could destroy smaller agencies that lack the staying power of the\nlarge companies.\nMarket allocation. Market allocation is the practice of colluding to restrict\ncompetitive activity in portions of a market in exchange for a reciprocal\nrestriction from a competitor: \"we won't compete against you here if you won't\ncompete against us there.\"\nFor example, Broker A agrees to trade only in single family re-sales, provided\nthat Broker B agrees to focus exclusively on apartment rentals and condominium\nsales. The net effect is an illegally restricted market where collusion and\nmonopoly supplant market forces.\nGroup boycott. Group boycotting is the illegal activity of a number of\ncompetitors in a given market \"ganging up\" on a competitor in that market to\nlimit the boycotted party's access to customers and patrons of the competitor's\nbusiness. For instance, a group of brokers might collectively refuse to show a\nboycotted broker's listings to potential buyers. Over time, the boycotted\ncompany is essentially \"starved\" out of the market.\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 191",

Loss of one's license is also at stake. Brokers are\nwell-advised to understand and recognize these laws.\nBUSINESS BROKERAGE\nBusiness brokerage vs. real property\nbrokerage\nTransaction knowledge\nAccounting\nDetermining a price\nBusiness brokerage regulation\nBusiness brokerage is effecting a sale or exchange of an existing business. In\nmost cases, the sale of a business entails the simultaneous transfer of an estate in\nland, whether a leasehold or a fee. Thus to sell businesses, a broker must\ngenerally hold a real estate license.\nIn some states, business brokerage is classified into opportunity brokerage and\nenterprise brokerage in accordance with the size of the business being sold.\nOpportunity brokerage concerns a small business, usually a proprietorship or\npartnership, where the transaction consists of a sale of assets and an assignment\nof a lease. Enterprise brokerage concerns a larger company, usually a\ncorporation, where the transaction involves the sale of stock and multiple real\nestate parcels leased or owned by the seller.\nThe process of business brokerage is similar to real estate brokerage: a broker\nsecures a listing, procures a purchaser, and facilitates the closing. Once a ready,\nwilling, and able buyer is found, the broker earns a commission.\nBusiness brokerage\nvs real property\nbrokerage The critical difference between selling a business and selling real estate is that\nselling a business includes the transfer of business income, personal property\nassets, and, possibly, liabilities, in addition to real property. To be competent in\nthis brokerage specialty, a business broker must have specialized skills\nconcerning transactions, accounting, and pricing. A business broker must also\nrely on a professional team to complete the transaction. Members of this team\nwould include the client's legal counsel, accountant, and, preferably, a\nprofessional appraiser.\nTransaction\nknowledge Types of sale. There are generally two types of business sale transaction for a\nbusiness broker to be aware of: the asset sale and the stock sale. In an asset sale,\nthe purchaser takes possession of some or all of the assets of the business, as well\nas the real estate, in exchange for the sale price. The purchase usually does not\n192 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "include acquiring the existing business entity or its liabilities. An asset sale is\npreferred by buyers who want to buy only portions of a business, or to avoid\nliabilities inherent in a stock purchase.\nIn a stock sale, a purchaser acquires complete ownership of a business, including\nthe legal corporate entity, all assets, all financial liabilities, and any current or\nfuture legal liabilities arising from incidents that have occurred prior to the sale.\nA purchaser may prefer a stock sale to avoid creating a new business entity or to\nbenefit from a possible tax advantage. In addition, a stock sale keeps a business\nidentity intact, which can be very valuable.\nTransaction documents. The most common transaction documents in business\nbrokerage are a sale contract, an assignment or real estate sale contract, a no-\ncompete agreement, and a consulting agreement.\nA sale contract sets forth all terms and conditions of the agreement, including\nexactly what is being sold. An assignment or real estate sale agreement is an\nagreement for transferring any and all real property involved in the transaction. A\nno-compete agreement is a seller's covenant, for compensation, not to compete\nwith the buyer under prescribed conditions and time periods. A consulting\nagreement is an employment agreement that hires the seller to assist the buyer in\ntaking over business operations.\nFor the most part, transaction documents in business brokerage are not fully\nstandardized. For that reason, a business broker must exercise caution in dealing\nwith document language so as to avoid the unauthorized practice of law.\nAccounting A broker or agent who wants to undertake business brokerage needs basic\nproficiency in accounting. In particular, one must know how to read and\ninterpret:\n\uf034 income, expenses, and profit on an income statement\n\uf034 assets, liabilities, and net worth on a balance sheet\nIncome, expenses, and profit. A business's profit is the revenue remaining from\ngross income after all expenses have been paid. A business broker must evaluate\nan owner's income and expenses in order to determine what the business may be\nworth to a buyer. This often involves interpreting which income and expense\nitems will change after the business is sold. For example, a seller owns a grocery\nstore and uses family members to perform clerical work without pay. If a buyer is\na bachelor without children, much of the clerical work will have to be hired out.\nThe additional payroll suddenly changes the store's profitability significantly.\nNeglecting to consider how income and expenses might change is likely to lead\nto serious problems in working with buyers.\nBusiness assets. The assets of a business include tangible assets and intangible\nassets. Tangible assets include:\n\uf034 cash and marketable securities\n\uf034 inventory\n\uf034 trade fixtures and equipment\nChapter 13 General Brokerage Practices 193",

Business liabilities acquired in a corporate stock sale include\nshort-term debt, such as accounts payable, and long-term liabilities, such as\nmortgages and leases.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is a business brokerage term with two meanings. In one\nsense, goodwill is an intangible asset consisting of any factor that an owner\nvalues in the business, apart from any other specific asset. For example, goodwill\nmight include reputation, a long history of success in a market, name recognition,\na dominant market share, and an excellent business location. In the second sense,\nwhich is more familiar to accountants, goodwill is the difference in value between\nan owner's price and the value of all other business assets. For example, if an\nowner wants $400,000 for a business, and the totality of tangible and intangible\nassets is valued at $320,000, the goodwill is an $80,000 asset.\nDetermining a price The most difficult task for a business broker is often finding the proper price\nrange for a business. An owner of a smaller business has probably built the\nbusiness from scratch and tends to overvalue it. Moreover, such an owner may\nhave incomplete and disorganized accounting records, making the valuation of\nassets quite difficult. Finally, a business's true income may be different for one\nowner than it would be for another because of variations in management style\nand ability.\nIn any case, the value of the business is a function of the following:\n\uf034 past, present, and future net profits, and capitalized value of these\n\uf034 amount of risk and certainty associated with realizing future\nprofits\n\uf034 value of all assets as reflected in the books of account\n\uf034 impact of goodwill on the value of the business\n\uf034 prices paid for similar businesses\n\uf034 all other risks associated with the business\nBusiness brokerage\nregulation\nLicensing. A business broker generally must have an active real estate license. In\naddition, the broker may need to have a valid securities license since a transaction\nmay entail the sale of securities.\n194 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

If a\nbusiness sells over half of its inventory to a buyer, the act declares that the sale is\na bulk sale, and, as such, is potentially an asset sale. Since a creditor could lose\nsecurity in such a sale, the seller must disclose the names of creditors to the buyer\nin a Bulk Sales Affidavit.

It is the\ndocument that is at the center of the transaction.\nThe conventional transfer of real estate ownership takes place in three stages.\nFirst, there is the negotiating period where buyers and sellers exchange offers in\nan effort to agree to all transfer terms that will appear in the sale contract.\nSecond, when both parties have accepted all terms, the offer becomes a binding\nsale contract and the transaction enters the pre-closing stage, during which each\nparty makes arrangements to complete the sale according to the sale contract's\nterms. Third is the closing of the transaction, when the seller deeds title to the\nbuyer, the buyer pays the purchase price, and all necessary documents are\ncompleted. At this stage, the sale contract has served its purpose and terminates.\nOther names for the sale contract are agreement of sale, contract for\npurchase, contract of purchase and sale, and earnest money contract.\nLegal characteristics Executory contract. A sale contract is executory: the signatories have yet to\nperform their respective obligations and promises. Upon closing, the sale\ncontract is fully performed and no longer exists as a binding agreement.\nSignatures. All owners of the property should sign the sale contract. If the\nsellers are married, both spouses should sign to ensure that both spouses release\nhomestead, dower, and curtesy rights to the buyer at closing. Failure to do so\ndoes not invalidate the contract but can lead to encumbered title and legal\ndisputes.\n198 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Enforceability criteria. To be enforceable, a sale contract must:\n\uf034 be validly created (mutual consent, consideration, legal purpose,\ncompetent parties, voluntary act)\n\uf034 be in writing\n\uf034 identify the principal parties\n\uf034 clearly identify the property, preferably by legal description\n\uf034 contain a purchase price\n\uf034 be signed by the principal parties\nWritten vs. oral form. A contract for the sale of real estate is enforceable only if\nit is in writing. A buyer or seller cannot sue to force the other to comply with an\noral contract for sale, even if the contract is valid.\nAssignment. Either party to a sale transaction can assign the sale contract to\nanother party, subject to the provisions and conditions contained in the agreement.\nWho may complete. A broker or agent may assist buyer and seller in completing\nan offer to purchase, provided the broker represents the client faithfully and does\nnot charge a separate fee for the assistance. It is advisable, and legally required in\nmost states, for a broker to use a standard contract form promulgated by state\nagencies or real estate boards, as such forms contain generally accepted language.\nThis relieves the broker of the dangers of creating new contract language, which\ncan be construed as a practice of law for which the broker is not licensed.\nContract creation Offer and acceptance. A contract of sale is created by full and unequivocal\nacceptance of an offer. Offer and acceptance may come from either buyer or\nseller. The offeree must accept the offer without making any changes\nwhatsoever. A change terminates the offer and creates a new offer, or\ncounteroffer. An offeror may revoke an offer for any reason prior to\ncommunication of acceptance by the offeree.\nEquitable title. A sale contract gives the buyer an interest in the property that is\ncalled equitable title, or ownership in equity. If the seller defaults and the buyer\ncan show good faith performance, the buyer can sue for specific performance, that\nis, to compel the seller to transfer legal title upon payment of the contract price.\nEarnest money\nescrow The buyer's earnest money deposit fulfills the consideration requirements for a\nvalid sale contract. In addition, it provides potential compensation for damages to\nthe seller if the buyer fails to perform. The amount of the deposit varies\naccording to local custom. It should be noted that the earnest money deposit is\nnot the only form of consideration that satisfies the requirement.\nThe sale contract provides the escrow instructions for handling and disbursing\nescrow funds. The earnest money is placed in a third party trust account or\nescrow. A licensed escrow agent employed by a title company, financial\ninstitution, or brokerage company usually manages the escrow. An individual\nbroker may also serve as the escrow agent.\nThe escrow holder acts as an impartial fiduciary for buyer and seller. If the buyer\nperforms under the sale contract, the deposit is applied to the purchase price.\nChapter 14 Overview of Conveyance Contracts 199",

    "text": "Strict rules govern the handling of earnest money deposits, particularly if a\nbroker is the escrow agent. For example, state laws direct the broker when to\ndeposit the funds, how to account for them, and how to keep them separate from\nthe broker's own funds.\nContract\ncontingencies A sale contract often contains contingencies. A contingency is a condition that\nmust be met before the contract is enforceable.\nThe most common contingency concerns financing. A buyer makes an offer\ncontingent upon securing financing for the property under certain terms on or\nbefore a certain date. If unable to secure the specified loan commitment by the\ndeadline, the buyer may cancel the contract and recover the deposit. An\nappropriate and timely loan commitment eliminates the contingency, and the\nbuyer must proceed with the purchase.\nIt is possible for both buyers and sellers to abuse contingencies in order to leave\nthemselves a convenient way to cancel without defaulting. To avoid problems,\nthe statement of a contingency should:\n\uf034 be explicit and clear\n\uf034 have an expiration date\n\uf034 expressly require diligence in the\neffort to fulfill the requirement\nA contingency that is too broad, vague, or excessive in duration may invalidate\nthe entire contract on the grounds of insufficiency of mutual agreement.\nDefault A sale contract is bilateral, since both parties promise to perform. As a result,\neither party may default by failing to perform. Note that a party's failure to meet a\ncontingency does not constitute default, but rather entitles the parties to cancel\nthe contract.\nBuyer default. If a buyer fails to perform under the terms of a sale contract, the\nbreach entitles the seller to legal recourse for damages. In most cases, the\ncontract itself stipulates the seller's remedies. The usual remedy is forfeiture of\nthe buyer's deposit as liquidated damages, provided the deposit is not grossly in\nexcess of the seller's actual damages. It is also customary to provide for the seller\nand broker to share the liquidated damages. The broker may not, however,\nreceive liquidated damages in excess of what the commission would have been\non the full listing price.\nIf the contract does not provide for liquidated damages, the seller may sue for\ndamages, cancellation, or specific performance.\nSeller default.

One or more clauses will identify the\nparties, the property, and the basic consideration, which is the sale of the property\nin return for a purchase price.\nThere must be at least two parties to a sale contract: one cannot convey property\nto oneself. All parties must be identified, be of legal age, and have the capacity to\ncontract.\nThe property clause also identifies fixtures and personal property included in the\nsale. Unless expressly excluded, items commonly construed as fixtures are\nincluded in the sale. Similarly, items commonly considered personal property are\nnot included unless expressly included.\nLegal description. A legal description must be sufficient for a competent\nsurveyor to identify the property.\nPrice and terms. A clause states the final price and details how the purchase will\noccur. Of particular interest to the seller is the buyer's down payment, since the\ngreater the buyer's equity, the more likely the buyer will be able to secure\nfinancing. In addition, a large deposit represents a buyer's commitment to\ncomplete the sale.\nIf seller financing is involved, the sale contract sets forth the terms of the\narrangement: the amount and type of loan, the rate and term, and how the loan\nwill be paid off.\nIt is important for all parties to verify that the buyer's earnest money deposit,\ndown payment, loan proceeds, and other promised funds together equal the\npurchase price stated in the contract.\nChapter 14 Overview of Conveyance Contracts 201",

If the buyer cannot secure the stated financing by the deadline, the parties\nmay agree to extend the contingency by signing next to the changed dates.\nEarnest money deposit. A clause specifies how the buyer will pay the earnest\nmoney. It may allow the buyer to pay it in installments. Such an option enables a\nbuyer to hold on to the property briefly while obtaining the additional deposit\nfunds. For example, a buyer who wants to buy a house makes an initial deposit of\n$200, to be followed in twenty-four hours with an additional $2,000. The sale\ncontract includes the seller's acknowledgment of receipt of the deposit.\nEscrow. An escrow clause provides for the custody and disbursement of the\nearnest money deposit, and releases the escrow agent from certain liabilities in\nthe performance of escrow duties.\nClosing and possession dates. The contract states when title will transfer, as\nwell as when the buyer will take physical possession. Customarily, possession\noccurs on the date when the deed is recorded, unless the buyer has agreed to other\narrangements.\nThe closing clause generally describes what must take place at closing to avoid\ndefault. A seller must provide clear and marketable title. A buyer must produce\npurchase funds. Failure to complete any pre-closing requirements stated in the\nsale contract is default and grounds for the aggrieved party to seek recourse.\nConveyed interest; type of deed. One or more provisions will state what type of\ndeed the seller will use to convey the property, and what conditions the deed will\nbe subject to. Among common \"subject to\" conditions are easements, association\nmemberships, encumbrances, mortgages, liens, and special assessments.\nTypically, the seller conveys a fee simple interest by means of a general warranty\ndeed.\nTitle evidence. The seller covenants to produce the best possible evidence of\nproperty ownership. This is commonly in the form of title insurance.\nClosing costs. The contract identifies which closing costs each party will pay.\nCustomarily, the seller pays title and property-related costs, and the buyer pays\nfinancing-related costs. Annual costs such as taxes and insurance are prorated\nbetween the parties. Note that who pays any particular closing cost is an item for\nnegotiation.\nDamage and destruction. A clause stipulates the obligations of the parties in\ncase the property is damaged or destroyed. The parties may negotiate\nalternatives, including seller's obligation to repair, buyer's obligation to buy if\nrepairs are made, and the option for either party to cancel.\nDefault. A default clause identifies remedies for default. Generally, a buyer may\nsue for damages, specific performance, or cancellation.

    "text": "OPTION-TO-BUY CONTRACT\nContract requirements\nCommon provisions\nLegal aspects\nAn option-to-buy is an enforceable contract in which a potential seller, the\noptionor, grants a potential buyer, the optionee, the right to purchase a property\nbefore a stated time for a stated price and terms. In exchange for the right of\noption, the optionee pays the optionor valuable consideration.\nFor example, a buyer wants to purchase a property for $150,000, but needs to sell\na boat to raise the down payment. The boat will take two or three months to sell.\nTo accommodate the buyer, the seller offers the buyer an option to purchase the\nproperty at any time before midnight on the day that is ninety days from the date\nof signing the option. The buyer pays the seller $1,000 for the option. If buyer\nexercises the option, the seller will apply the $1,000 toward the earnest money\ndeposit and subsequent down payment. If the optionee lets the option expire, the\nseller keeps the $1,000. Both parties agree to the arrangement by completing a\nsale contract as an addendum to the option, then executing the option agreement\nitself.\nAn option-to-buy places the optionee under no obligation to purchase the\nproperty. However, the seller must perform under the terms of the contract if the\nbuyer exercises the option. An option is thus a unilateral agreement. Exercise of\nthe option creates a bilateral sale contract where both parties are bound to\nperform. An unused option terminates at the expiration date.\nAn optionee can use an option to prevent the sale of a property to another party\nwhile seeking to raise funds for the purchase. A renter with a lease option-to-buy\ncan accumulate down payment funds while paying rent to the landlord. For\nexample, an owner may lease a condominium to a tenant with an option to buy. If\nthe tenant takes the option, the landlord agrees to apply $100 of the monthly rent\npaid prior to the option date toward the purchase price. The tenant pays the\nlandlord the nominal sum of $200 for the option.\nOptions can also facilitate commercial property acquisition. The option period\ngives a buyer time to investigate zoning, space planning, building permits,\nenvironmental impacts, and other feasibility issues prior to the purchase without\nlosing the property to another party in the meantime.\nContract\nrequirements To be valid and enforceable, an option-to-buy must:\n\uf034 include actual, non-refundable consideration\nThe option must require the optionee to pay a specific\nconsideration that is separate from the purchase price. The\nconsideration cannot be refunded if the option is not exercised. If\nthe option is exercised, the consideration may be applied to the\nChapter 14 Overview of Conveyance Contracts 205",

An option should be recorded, because the equitable interest it\ncreates can affect the marketability of title.\nAssignment. An option-to-buy is assignable unless the contract expressly\nprohibits assignment.\nCONTRACT FOR DEED\nInterests and rights\nLegal form\nDefault and recourse\nUsage guidelines\nA contract for deed is also called a land contract, an installment sale, a\nconditional sales contract, and an agreement for deed. It is a bilateral agreement\nbetween a seller, the vendor, and a buyer, the vendee, in which the vendor defers\nreceipt of some or all of the purchase price of a property over a specified period\nof time. During the period, the vendor retains legal title and the vendee acquires\nequitable title. The vendee takes possession of the property, makes stipulated\npayments of principal and interest to the vendor, and otherwise fulfills\nobligations as the contract requires. At the end of the period, the buyer pays the\nvendor the full purchase price and the vendor deeds legal title to the vendee.\nLike an option, a contract for deed offers a means for a marginally qualified\nbuyer to acquire property. In essence, the seller acts as lender, allowing the buyer\nto take possession and pay off the purchase price over time. A buyer may thus\navoid conventional down payment and income requirements imposed by\ninstitutional lenders. During the contract period, the buyer can work to raise the\nnecessary cash to complete the purchase or to qualify for a conventional\nmortgage.\nA contract for deed serves two primary purposes for a seller. First, it facilitates a\nsale that might otherwise be impossible. Second, it may give the seller certain\ntax benefits. Since the seller is not liable for capital gains tax until the purchase\nprice is received, the installment sale lowers the seller's tax liability in the year\nof the sale.\nChapter 14 Overview of Conveyance Contracts 207",

Therefore, this kind of conveyance presents certain\npitfalls for buyer and seller.\nIn some states, a breach of the contract for deed is remedied under local contract\nlaw rather than foreclosure law. The buyer may not have the protections of a\nredemption period or other buyer-protection laws which accompany formal\nforeclosure proceedings.

However, brokers and agents do need a basic understanding of\nhow our economy works, and particularly, how real estate as an economic\nproduct fits into the real estate marketplace.\nUnderstanding the fundamentals of real estate economics enables one to:\n\uf034 recognize the effect of current economic conditions in the real estate\nmarket on transactions, prices, and values\n\uf034 apply economic principles to estimates of future conditions in the\nreal estate market\n\uf034 apply economic principles to specific geographical areas and\nproperty types in order to assess economic conditions for a\nparticular property and site\nThese are abilities that will benefit the clients of any real estate professional.\nTHE MARKET SYSTEM\nSupply and demand\nPrice and value\nProductivity and costs\nMarket interaction\nMarket equilibrium\nSupply and demand The goal of an economic system is to produce and distribute a supply of goods\nand services to satisfy the demand of its constituents.

In addition to supply and demand, the other critical\ncomponent of an economic system is the price mechanism, or simply, price. A\nprice is the amount of money or other asset that a buyer has agreed to pay and a\nseller has agreed to accept to complete the exchange of a good or service. It is a\nquantification of the value of an item traded.\nPrice in this context means the final trading price; it is not the preliminary asking\nprice of the seller nor the initial bidding price of the purchaser. Asking and\nbidding prices are pricing positions in a negotiation between the parties prior to\nthe exchange. The true price of an item or service is the final number the parties\nagree to.\nValue and value determinants. Price is not something of value in itself. It is\nonly a number that quantifies value. The economic issue underlying the interplay\nof supply and demand is, how do trading parties arrive at the value of a good or\nservice as indicated by the price?\n212 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Consider consumer demand for air conditioners. Why do air conditioners have\nvalue? How do they command the price they do?\nThe value of something is based on the answers to four questions:\n\uf034 How much do I desire it?\n\uf034 How useful is it?\n\uf034 How scarce is it?\n\uf034 Am I able to pay for it?\nDesire. One determinant of value is how dear the item is to the purchaser.\nReturning to the air conditioner example, the question becomes \"how much do I\ndesire to be cool, dry, and comfortable?\" To a person who lives in the tropics, it\nis safe to say that air conditioning is more valuable than a heating system. It is\nalso safe to say the opposite is true for residents of northern Alaska.\nUtility. The second determinant of value is the product's ability to do the job. Can\nthe air conditioner satisfy my need to stay cool? How cool does it make my\nhouse? Does it even work properly? Of course, I won't pay as much if it is old or\nineffectual.\nScarcity. The third critical element of value is a product's availability in relation\nto demand. The air conditioner is quite valuable if there are only five units in the\nentire city and everyone is hot. On the other hand, the value of an air conditioner\ngoes down if there are ten thousand units for sale in a 500-person market.\nPurchasing power. A fourth component of value is the consumer's ability to pay\nfor the item. If one cannot afford to buy the air conditioner, the value of the air\nconditioner is diminished, since it is financially out of reach. If all air\nconditioners are too expensive, consumers are forced to consider alternatives\nsuch as ceiling fans.\nIn the marketplace, the relative presence or absence of the four elements of value\nis constantly changing due to innumerable factors. Since price is a reflection of\nthe total of all value factors at any time, changes in the underlying factors of\nvalue trigger changes in price.\nProductivity\nand costs To produce a good or service, a supplier incurs costs, or those expenses necessary\nto generate and deliver the item to the market. The essential production costs are\nthe costs of capital, materials, and supplies; labor; management; and overhead.\nCosts play an important role in the dynamics of supply, demand, and value. Since\na producer has limited resources, it is imperative to maximize the efficiency of\nthe production process and minimize its costs. Moreover, since consumers will\npay the lowest possible price for comparable goods and services, the producer\nmust be price-competitive to stay in business. A competitor who can produce an\nitem of similar quality for less will eventually force higher-priced items out of the\nmarket.\nCost and price. Consider a producer who is efficient and produces the product or\nservice in demand at the lowest possible cost. Adding to the cost a required profit\nmargin, the producer establishes a minimum price for the item. In this scenario,\nChapter 15 Market Economics 213",

    "text": "cost essentially equals price. To the efficient producer, costs and sufficient profit\nare paramount, since a lower price puts the producer out of business. At that\npoint, the elements of value-- desire, utility, scarcity, and purchasing power-- do\nnot matter: if the consumer wants the item at all, he or she must cover the\nproducer's costs and profit.\nIn summary, supply, demand, and price interact continuously in a market.\nUnderlying and influencing these forces are the dynamics of value and the costs\nof producing goods and services.\nMarket interaction What is a market? A market is a place where supply and demand encounter one\nanother: suppliers sell or trade their goods and services to demanders, who are\nconsumers and buyers. It is a transaction arena where the price mechanism is\nconstantly defining and quantifying the value produced by the relative elements\nof supply and demand.\nSupply, demand and price interrelationships. In a market economy, the\nprimary interactions between supply, demand and price are:\n\uf034 if supply increases relative to demand, price decreases\n\uf034 if supply decreases relative to demand, price increases\n\uf034 if demand increases relative to supply, price increases\n\uf034 if demand decreases relative to supply, price decreases\nThese relationships reflect simple common sense: if a valued product becomes\nincreasingly scarce, its value and price go up as consumers compete for the limited\nsupply. If there is an overabundance of a product, the price falls, as demand is\nlargely met. On the other side, if demand for a product or service increases in\nrelation to supply, prices will go up as consumers compete for the popular item.\nIf demand diminishes, the price drops with it.\nThe inverse of these principles also applies. By tracking a price trend, one can\ndraw conclusions about supply and demand trends:\n\uf034 if price decreases, demand is declining in relation to supply\n\uf034 if price increases, demand is increasing in relation to supply\nTo assess price movements, the supply and demand of a product or service must\nalways be considered together. It is always possible for demand and supply to\nrise and fall together at the same rate, with no detectable price change resulting.\nFor example, if demand for bicycles jumps a million units, and manufacturers\neasily produce the necessary new supply, there may be no increase in price. The\nprice may even go down as manufacturers obtain better prices on the larger\nquantities of raw materials they now use.\nMarket equilibrium Another significant principle of supply/demand/price interaction is market\nequilibrium:\n\uf034 a market tends toward a state of equilibrium in which supply\nequals demand, and price, cost, and value are identical\n214 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "According to this principle, market demand moves to meet supply, and supply\nmoves to meet demand. If there is an extreme shortage of an item for which there\nis normally a strong demand, suppliers will rush to increase production to close\nthe gap. If inventories of an item are very high, suppliers will stop production\nuntil the oversupply has been depleted.\nSimilarly, if the price of an item far exceeds its cost, new suppliers will enter the\nmarket with lower prices. If the price of an item is far less than its perceived\nvalue, either consumers will bid up the price or the perceived value will decline.\nFor example, a new convenience store opens on the edge of a rapidly growing\ntown. The owners know demand will increase, so they anticipate the demand\nwith their increment of supply. Initially, the store creates excess supply, so\nbusiness is slow. However, as people move in, demand increases, and the store\nbegins to make substantial profits. After some time, other retailers hear that the\nstore is profitable: demand now significantly exceeds supply, and the operator's\ncosts are out of line with values and prices. A second retailer opens a store to\nequalize the imbalance. The new competitor, an addition of supply, now forces\nprices, costs, and profits into closer proximity.\nThe equilibrium time lag. In theory, markets strive for equilibrium, but in\nreality there is always a time lag between a recognized imbalance and the\ncompletion of the market adjustment. Since the underlying determinants of\nsupply and demand (scarcity, desire, utility, purchasing power and costs) are\nconstantly changing, a market is usually in some condition of imbalance.\nREAL ESTATE MARKET DYNAMICS\nEconomic characteristics of real estate\nReal estate supply and demand\nMarket influences on supply and demand\nAs an economic commodity, real estate is bought, sold, traded, and leased as a\nproduct within a real estate market.\nEconomic\ncharacteristics\nof real estate Real estate, like other products and services, is:\n\uf034 subject to the laws of supply and demand\n\uf034 governed in the market by the price mechanism\n\uf034 influenced by the producer's costs to bring the product to market\n\uf034 influenced by the determinants of value: utility, scarcity, desire,\nand purchasing power\nDistinguishing features.

Likewise, no two parcels of real estate can have exactly\nthe same value, except by coincidence.\n\uf034 demand must come to the supply\nSince real property cannot be moved, real property investors and\nusers must come to the supply. This creates risk, because if\ndemand drops, the supply cannot be transported to a higher\ndemand market.\n\uf034 illiquid\nReal estate is a relatively illiquid economic product, meaning it\ncannot always be readily sold for cash. Since it is a large, long-\nterm investment that has no exact duplicate, buyers must go\nthrough a complex process to evaluate and purchase the right\nparcel of real estate.\n\uf034 slow to respond to changes\nReal estate is relatively slow to respond to market imbalances.\nBecause new construction is a large-scale, time-consuming\nprocess, the market is slow to respond to increases in demand.

Residential demand can be further broken\ndown into demand to lease versus buy, and demand for single family homes\nversus apartments.\nResidential demand can be very difficult to quantify. One measure is the number\nof buyers employing agents to locate property. Another measure is the net\npopulation change in an area, plus families that attempted to move in but could\nnot.\nThe unit of commercial (retail and office) and industrial real estate demand is the\nsquare foot, further broken down into demand for leased space versus purchased\nspace. In most instances, the area demanded refers to the improved area rather\nthan the total lot area.\nDemand for office and industrial real estate is calculated by identifying\nemployment growth or shrinkage in a market, then multiplying the employment\nchange times the average area of floor space a typical employee uses. For\nexample, consider an office property market where employment in the\ncommunity increases by 500 employees. If each employee uses an average of 120\nsquare feet, the increased demand for space is 60,000 square feet.\nFactors affecting demand. The demand for particular types of real estate relates\nto the specific concerns of users.

In addition,\nservice businesses emerge to support the many needs of the local population\nengaged in primary and secondary employment.\nThus, base employment feeds total employment. Total employment in a market\nincludes base, secondary, and support industries. Total employment creates a\ndemand for a labor force. From total employment derives demand for industrial\nand office space on the one hand; on the other hand, as employment grows, so\ngrows the population, leading to the demand for housing and for retail support. In\naddition to creating demand for real estate, employment creates the purchasing\npower necessary for households to acquire dwellings and retail products.\nWithout employment, a real estate market evaporates, as there is no demand for\ncommercial or industrial facilities, nor is there demand for retail services or\nhousing. The best example of this phenomenon is a gold rush boom town: as\nsoon as the gold runs out, there is no more mining. Without mining employment,\neveryone moves away and the town becomes a ghost town.\nSupply and demand interaction. Real estate supply and demand, like supply\nand demand for other economic products, interact in the marketplace to produce\nprice movements.\nExhibit 15.3 Real Estate Supply-Demand Cycle\nChapter 15 Market Economics 219",

Vacancy is the\namount of total real estate inventory of a certain type that is unoccupied at a\ngiven time. Absorption is the amount of available property that becomes\noccupied over a period of time.\nTaking the point of undersupply, or high demand, as a starting point in the cycle,\nvacancy is low and prices are high. This situation stimulates suppliers to\nconstruct additional housing or commercial space. New construction, by adding\nsupply, causes vacancy to rise and prices to fall until supply-demand equilibrium\nresults. As more new space is added, supply begins to outstrip demand, vacancy\ncontinues to rise, and prices continue to fall. At the bottom of the cycle, prices\nand vacancy are at unacceptable levels, and construction ceases. The market\n\"dies\" until excess supply can be absorbed. The absorption process continues\nthrough the equilibrium point until price and vacancy conditions are sufficiently\nattractive to encourage renewed construction. Then the cycle repeats.\nMarket influences\nOn supply and\ndemand Numerous factors in a market influence the real estate cycle to speed up or slow\ndown. These influences can be local or national, and from the public or private\neconomic sector.\nLocal market influences.

Regional and national economic forces influence the local real\nestate market in the form of:\n\uf034 changes in money supply\n\uf034 inflation\n\uf034 national economic cycles\nIn recent years international economic trends have increasingly influenced local\nreal estate markets, particularly in border states, large metropolitan areas, and in\nmarkets where the economic base is tied to foreign trade. In these instances,\ncurrency fluctuations have significant impact on the local economy.\nGovernmental influences. Governments at every level exert significant\ninfluence over local real estate markets.

Its role is particularly critical in the transfer of real property,\nsince the value of a parcel establishes the general price range for the principal\nparties to negotiate.\nReal estate value in general is the present monetary worth of benefits arising\nfrom the ownership of real estate. The primary benefits that contribute to real\nestate value are:\n\uf034 income\n\uf034 appreciation\n\uf034 use\n\uf034 tax benefits\nOwnership of real estate produces income when there are leases on the land, the\nimprovements, or on air, surface, or subsurface rights. Such income is part of real\nestate value because an investor will pay money to buy the income stream\ngenerated by ownership of the property.\nAppreciation is an increase in the market value of a parcel of land over time,\nusually resulting from a general rise in sale prices of real estate throughout a\nmarket area. Such an increase, whether actual or projected, is another investment\nbenefit that contributes to real estate value.\nThe way a property is used -- whether residential, commercial, agricultural,\nrecreational, etc. -- in large part determines the property's value. Each kind of use\nhas its own benefits.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 223",

    "text": "Depending on current tax law, tax benefits from ownership of a property may\ntake the form of preferred treatment of capital gain, tax losses, depreciation, and\ndeferrals of tax liability. These tax benefits contribute to the income and potential\nsale price of a property.\nFoundations of real\nestate value A number of economic forces interact in the marketplace to contribute to real\nestate value. Among the most recognized of these principles are those listed\nbelow.\nExhibit 16.1 Economic Principles Underlying Real Estate Value\nsupply and demand change\nutility transferability highest and best use\nanticipation substitution conformity\ncontribution progression and regression\nassemblage\nsubdivision\nSupply and demand. The availability of certain properties interacts with the\nstrength of the demand for those properties to establish prices. When demand for\nproperties exceeds supply, a condition of scarcity exists, and real estate values\nrise. When supply exceeds demand, a condition of surplus exists, and real estate\nvalues decline. When supply and demand are generally equivalent, the market is\nconsidered to be in balance, and real estate values stabilize.\nUtility. The fact that a property has a use in a certain marketplace contributes to\nthe demand for it. Use is not the same as function. For instance, a swampy area\nmay have an ecological function as a wetland, but it may have no economic utility\nif it cannot be put to some use that people in the marketplace are willing to pay\nfor.\nTransferability. How readily or easily title or rights to real estate can be\ntransferred affects the property's value. Property that is encumbered has a value\nimpairment since buyers do not want unmarketable title. Similarly, property that\ncannot be transferred due to disputes among owners may cause the value to\ndecline, because the investment is wholly illiquid until the disputes are resolved.\nAnticipation. The benefits a buyer expects to derive from a property over a\nholding period influence what the buyer is willing to pay for it. For example, if\nan investor anticipates an annual rental income from a leased property to be one\nmillion dollars, this expected sum has a direct bearing on what the investor will\npay for the property.\nSubstitution. According to the principle of substitution, a buyer will pay no more\nfor a property than the buyer would have to pay for an equally desirable and\navailable substitute property. For example, if three houses for sale are essentially\nsimilar in size, quality and location, a potential buyer is unlikely to choose the\none that is priced significantly higher than the other two.\nContribution. The principal of contribution focuses on the degree to which a\nparticular improvement affects market value of the overall property. In essence,\nthe contribution of the improvement is equal to the change in market value that\nthe addition of the improvement causes. For example, adding a bathroom to a\nhouse may contribute an additional $15,000 to the appraised value. Thus the\ncontribution of the bathroom is $15,000. Note that an improvement's contribution\n224 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

  {
    "page_number": 224,
    "text": "to value has little to do with the improvement's cost. The foregoing bathroom\nmay have cost $5,000 or $20,000. Contribution is what the market recognizes as\nthe change in value, not what an item cost. If continuous improvements are added\nto a property, it is possible that, at some point, the cost of adding improvements\nto a property no longer contributes a corresponding increase in the value of the\nproperty. When this occurs, the property suffers from diminishing marginal\nreturn, where the costs to improve exceed contribution.\nChange. Market conditions are in a state of flux over time, just as the condition\nof a property itself changes. These fluctuations and changes will affect the\nbenefits that can arise from the property, and should be reflected in an estimate of\nthe property's value. For example, the construction of a neighborhood shopping\ncenter in the vicinity of a certain house may increase the desirability of the\nhouse's location, and hence, its value.\nHighest and best use. This principle holds that there is, theoretically, a single\nuse for a property that produces the greatest income and return. A property\nachieves its maximum value when it is put to this use. If the actual use is not the\nhighest and best use, the value of the property is correspondingly less than\noptimal. Technically, highest and best use must be legally permissible, physically\npossible, financially feasible, and maximally productive.\nFor example, a property with an old house on it may not be in its highest and best\nuse if it is surrounded by retail properties. If zoning permits the property to be\nconverted to a retail use, its highest and best use may well be retail rather than\nresidential.\nConformity. This principle holds that a property's maximal value is attained\nwhen its form and use are in tune with surrounding properties and uses. For\nexample, a two-bedroom, one-bathroom house surrounded by four-bedroom,\nthree-bathroom homes may derive maximal value from a room addition.\nProgression and regression. The value of a property influences, and is\ninfluenced by, the values of neighboring properties. If a property is surrounded\nby properties with higher values, its value will tend to rise (progression); if it is\nsurrounded by properties with lower values, its value will tend to fall\n(regression).\nAssemblage. Assemblage, or the conjoining of adjacent properties, sometimes\ncreates a combined value that is greater than the values of the unassembled\nproperties. The excess value created by assemblage is called plottage value.\nSubdivision. The division of a single property into smaller properties can also\nresult in a higher total value. For instance, a one-acre suburban site appraised at\n$50,000 may be subdivided into four quarter-acre lots worth $30,000 each. This\nprinciple contributes significantly to the financial feasibility of subdivision\ndevelopment.\nTypes of value The purpose of an appraisal influences an estimate of the value of a parcel of real\nestate. This is because there are different types of value related to different\nappraisal purposes. Some of the possibilities are listed below.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 225",

Market value is an estimate of the price at which a property will\nsell at a particular time. This type of value is the one generally sought in\nappraisals and used in brokers' estimates of value.\nReproduction value. Reproduction value is the value based on the cost of\nconstructing a precise duplicate of the subject property's improvements, assuming\ncurrent construction costs.\nReplacement value. Replacement value is the value based on the cost of\nconstructing a functional equivalent of the subject property's improvements,\nassuming current construction costs.\nSalvage value. Salvage value refers to the nominal value of a property that has\nreached the end of its economic life. Salvage value is also an estimate of the price\nat which a structure will sell if it is dismantled and moved.\nPlottage value. Plottage value is an estimate of the value that the process of\nassemblage adds to the combined values of the assembled properties.\nAssessed value. Assessed value is the value of a property as estimated by a\ntaxing authority as the basis for ad valorem taxation.\nCondemned value. Condemned value is the value set by a county or municipal\nauthority for a property which may be taken by eminent domain.\nDepreciated value. Depreciated value is a value established by subtracting\naccumulated depreciation from the purchase price of a property.\nReversionary value. Reversionary value is the estimated selling price of a\nproperty at some time in the future. This value is used most commonly in a\nproforma investment analysis where, at the end of a holding period, the property\nis sold and the investor's capital reverts to the investor.\nAppraised value. Appraised value is an appraiser's opinion of a property's value.\nRental value. Rental value is an estimate of the rental rate a property can\ncommand for a specific period of time.\nLeasehold value. Leasehold value is an estimate of the market value of a lessee's\ninterest in a property.\nInsured value. Insured value is the face amount a casualty or hazard insurance\npolicy will pay in case a property is rendered unusable.\n226 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Market price should theoretically be the same as market value if all the\nconditions essential for market value were present. Market price, however, may\nnot reflect the analysis of comparables and of investment value that an estimate\nof market value includes.\nThe appraisal\nand its uses While most appraisals seek to estimate market value, any of the types of value\ndescribed earlier may be the objective of an appraisal. An appraisal is\ndistinguished from other estimates of value in that it is an opinion of value\nsupported by data and performed by a professional, disinterested third party.\nAppraisers acting in a professional capacity are also regulated by state laws and\nbound to standards set by the appraisal industry.\nBroker's opinion of value.

The appraisal itself is used in real estate decision-making to estimate one or\nmore types of value, depending on the kind of decision to be made. Appraisals\nmay be ordered and used by mortgage lenders, government agencies, investors,\nutilities companies, and real estate buyers and sellers.\nAn appraisal helps in setting selling prices and rental rates, determining the level\nof insurance coverage, establishing investment values, and establishing the value\nof the real estate as collateral for a loan.\nAppraisals may be developed and reported in a narrative format or on a\nprescribed form with attachments. The most commonly used form for residential\nappraisals is the \"Uniform Residential Appraisal Report\" (URAR) promoted by\nthe Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan\nMortgage Corporation (FHLMC) (known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\nrespectively).\nMeasuring living\narea The concept of living area is fundamental to estimating residential property\nvalue, since a subject's living area is a major component of its desirability and\nmarket value. But what is living area, and how is it measured? Standards differ\nfrom state to state.\nANSI and Fannie Mae standards. ANSI (American National Standards\nInstitute) and Fannie Mae are the two most prominent organizations which\noriginate and propound modern measuring standards in national real estate\npractice. Current living area measurement standards can be found in ANSI and\nFannie Mae literature. The following guidelines are general and not intended to\nbe rigid or comprehensive. Practitioners must always be aware of and follow\nlocal measurement standards..\nThe principal ANSI and Fannie Mae standards for measuring gross living area\n(GLA) include the following. These standards mainly apply to single-family\nresidential properties.\n1. Gross living area is based on the dimensions of all rooms \"above grade\" as\nmeasured from the exterior walls of the premises, including stairwells but\nexcluding \"open areas.\" Space should be measured to the inch or to 1/10th of\na foot and living areas calculated and totaled.\n2. Above grade is defined as above the surface of the ground. Living area\nbelow-grade (one foot or more) must be counted as basement area \u2013 thus not\nas 100% living area.\n3. Minimum ceiling height for living area is 7 feet. In two-story properties (or\nmore) with sloped ceilings, at least 50% of the ceiling area must have a\nheight of 7 feet or more.\n4. Finished space: To be counted in GLA footage, a space must be finished,\ni.e., have a floor covering and a ceiling. Entry areas may be counted, but\nseasonal porches are excluded.\n228 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

For example, an\nunattached outbuilding cannot be counted in the total.\n6. Attics and basements: Partially finished or only partially heated areas may\nnot be counted as 100% GLA footage. Since these standards can vary widely\nfrom state to state, practitioners should ascertain the local standards that\napply.\n7. Garage areas are not fully countable if they are unattached, or attached but\nnot heated. However, they may meet a local standard if fully heated, finished\nand improved for other household uses.\n8. Stairs and closets: Both these improvement areas are generally fully\ncountable in GLA.\nUltimately, the most accurate measurement of living areas relies heavily on\nadherence to local standards and practices, and to practices dictated by mortgage\nunderwriters.\nSteps in the\nappraisal process A systematic procedure enables an appraiser to collect, organize and analyze the\nnecessary data to produce an appraisal report.\nExhibit 16.3 Steps in the Appraisal Process\n1.

Reconcile the values from the\napproaches\n7. Compile the report\nPurpose. The first step in the process is to define the appraisal problem and the\npurpose of the appraisal. This involves\n\uf034 identifying the subject property by legal description\n\uf034 specifying the interest to be appraised\n\uf034 specifying the purpose of the appraisal, for example, to identify\nmarket value for a purchase, identify rental levels, or establish a\nvalue as collateral for a loan\n\uf034 specifying the date for which the appraisal is valid\n\uf034 identifying the type of value to be estimated\nData. The second step is to collect, organize and analyze relevant data about the\nsubject property. Information relevant to the property includes notes and drawings\nfrom physical inspection of the subject, public tax and title records, and\nreproduction costs. Relevant information about the market includes\nenvironmental, demographic, and economic reports concerning the neighborhood,\ncommunity, and region.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 229",

It also serves as the basis for a broker's opinion of value.\nIt is based on the principle of substitution-- that a buyer will pay no more for the\nsubject property than would be sufficient to purchase a comparable property--\nand contribution-- that specific characteristics add value to a property.\nThe sales comparison approach is widely used because it takes into account the\nsubject property's specific amenities in relation to competing properties. In\naddition, because of the currency of its data, the approach incorporates present\nmarket realities.\nThe sales comparison approach is limited in that every property is unique. As a\nresult, it is difficult to find good comparables, especially for special-purpose\nproperties. In addition, the market must be active; otherwise, sale prices lack\ncurrency and reliability.\n230 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Steps in\nthe approach The sales comparison approach consists of comparing sale prices of recently sold\nproperties that are comparable with the subject and making dollar adjustments to\nthe price of each comparable to account for competitive differences with the\nsubject. After identifying the adjusted value of each comparable, the appraiser\nweights the reliability of each comparable and the factors underlying how the\nadjustments were made.

For example, to qualify as a comparable for a mortgage loan appraisal, a\nproperty might have to be located within one mile of the subject. Or perhaps the\nsize of the comparable must be within a certain percentage of improved area in\nrelation to the subject.\nThe time-of-sale criterion is important because transactions that occurred too far\nin the past will not reflect appreciation or recent changes in market conditions.\nAn arm's length sale involves objective, disinterested parties who are presumed to\nhave negotiated a market price for the property. If the sale of a house occurred\nbetween a father and a daughter, for example, one might assume that the\ntransaction did not reflect market value.\nPrincipal sources of data for generating the sales comparison are tax records, title\nrecords, and the local multiple listing service.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 231",

Note that the sale prices of the\ncomparables are known, while the value and price of the subject are not.\nTherefore, adjustments can be made only to the comparables' prices, not to the\nsubject's. Adjustments are made to the comparables in the form of a value\ndeduction or a value addition.\nAdding or deducting value. If the comparable is better than the subject in some\ncharacteristic, an amount is deducted from the sale price of the comparable. This\nneutralizes the comparable's competitive advantage in an adjustment category.\nFor example, a comparable has a swimming pool and the subject does not. To\nequalize the difference, the appraiser deducts an amount, say $6,000, from the\nsale price of the comparable. Note that the adjustment reflects the contribution of\nthe swimming pool to market value. The adjustment amount is not the cost of the\npool or its depreciated value.\nIf the comparable is inferior to the subject in some characteristic, an amount is\nadded to the price of the comparable.

    "text": "Weighting\ncomparables Adding and subtracting the appropriate adjustments to the sale price of each\ncomparable results in an adjusted price for the comparables that indicates the\nvalue of the subject. The last step in the approach is to perform a weighted\nanalysis of the indicated values of each comparable. The appraiser, in other\nwords, must identify which comparable values are more indicative of the subject\nand which are less indicative.\nAn appraiser primarily relies on experience and judgment to weight comparables.\nThere is no formula for selecting a value from within the range of all\ncomparables analyzed. However, there are three quantitative guidelines: the total\nnumber of adjustments; the amount of a single adjustment; and the net value\nchange of all adjustments.\nAs a rule, the fewer the total number of adjustments, the smaller the adjustment\namounts, and the less the total adjustment amount, the more reliable the\ncomparable.\nNumber of adjustments. In terms of total adjustments, the comparable with the\nfewest adjustments tends to be most similar to the subject, hence the best\nindicator of value. If a comparable requires excessive adjustments, it is\nincreasingly less reliable as an indicator of value. The underlying rationale is that\nthere is a margin of error involved in making any adjustment. Whenever a\nnumber of adjustments must be made, the margin of error compounds. By the\ntime six or seven adjustments are made, the margin becomes significant, and the\nreliability of the final value estimate is greatly reduced.\nSingle adjustment amounts. The dollar amount of an adjustment represents the\nvariance between the subject and the comparable for a given item. If a large\nadjustment is called for, the comparable becomes less of an indicator of value.\nThe smaller the adjustment, the better the comparable is as an indicator of value.\nIf an appraisal is performed for mortgage qualification, the appraiser may be\nrestricted from making adjustments in excess of a certain amount, for example,\nanything in excess of 10-15% of the sale price of the comparable. If such an\nadjustment would be necessary, the property is no longer considered comparable.\nTotal net adjustment amount. The third reliability factor in weighting\ncomparables is the total net value change of all adjustments added together. If a\ncomparable's total adjustments alter the indicated value only slightly, the\ncomparable is a good indicator of value. If total adjustments create a large dollar\namount between the sale price and the adjusted value, the comparable is a poorer\nindicator of value. Fannie Mae, for instance, will not accept the use of a\ncomparable where total net adjustments are in excess of 15% of the sale price.\nFor example, an appraiser is considering a property that sold for $500,000 as a\ncomparable. After all adjustments are made, the indicated value of the\ncomparable is $605,000, a 21% difference in the comparable's sale price. This\nproperty, if allowed at all, would be a weak indicator of value.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 233",

    "text": "Broker's comparative\nmarket analysis A broker or salesperson who is attempting to establish a listing price or range of\nprices for a property uses a scaled-down version of the appraiser's sales\ncomparison approach called a comparative market analysis, or CMA (also called\na competitive market analysis). While the CMA serves a useful purpose in\nsetting general price ranges, brokers and agents need to exercise caution in\npresenting a CMA as an appraisal, which it is not. Two important distinctions\nbetween the two are objectivity and comprehensiveness.\nFirst, the broker is not unbiased: he or she is motivated by the desire to obtain a\nlisting, which can lead one to distort the estimated price. Secondly, the broker's\nCMA is not comprehensive: the broker does not usually consider the full range\nof data about market conditions and comparable sales that the appraiser must\nconsider and document. Therefore, the broker's opinion will be less reliable than\nthe appraiser's.\nThe following exhibit illustrates the sales comparison approach. An appraiser is\nestimating market value for a certain house. Four comparables are adjusted to\nfind an indicated value for the subject. The grid which follows the property and\nmarket data shows the appraiser's adjustments for the differences between the\nfour comparables and the subject.\nFor practice with the sales comparison approach, see the exercise on page 411 in\nthe math chapter.\n234 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

It is also used for\nspecial-purpose buildings which cannot be valued by the other methods because\nof lack of comparable sales or income data.\nThe strengths of the cost approach are that it:\n\uf034 provides an upper limit for the subject's value based on the\nundepreciated cost of reproducing the improvements\n\uf034 is very accurate for a property with new improvements which are\nthe highest and best use of the property.\nThe limitations of the cost approach are that:\n\uf034 the cost to create improvements is not necessarily the same as\nmarket value\n\uf034 depreciation is difficult to measure, especially for older buildings\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 237",

    "text": "Types of cost\nappraised The cost approach generally aims to estimate either the reproduction cost or the\nreplacement cost of the subject property.\nReproduction cost is the cost of constructing, at current prices, a precise\nduplicate of the subject improvements. Replacement cost is the cost of\nconstructing, at current prices and using current materials and methods, a\nfunctional equivalent of the subject improvements.\nReplacement cost is used primarily for appraising older structures, since it is\nimpractical to consider reproducing outmoded features and materials. However,\nreproduction cost is preferable whenever possible because it facilitates the\ncalculation of depreciation on a structure.\nDepreciation A cornerstone of the cost approach is the concept of depreciation. Depreciation is\nthe loss of value in an improvement over time. Since land is assumed to retain its\nvalue indefinitely, depreciation only applies to the improved portion of real\nproperty. The loss of an improvement's value can come from any cause, such as\ndeterioration, obsolescence, or changes in the neighborhood. The sum of\ndepreciation from all causes is accrued depreciation.\nAn appraiser considers depreciation as having three causes: physical\ndeterioration, functional obsolescence, and economic obsolescence.\nPhysical deterioration. Physical deterioration is wear and tear from use, decay,\nand structural deterioration. Such deterioration may be either curable or\nincurable.\nCurable deterioration occurs when the costs of repair of the item are less than or\nequal to the resulting increase in the property's value. For example, if a paint job\ncosts $6,000, and the resulting value increase is $8,000, the deterioration is\nconsidered curable. Incurable deterioration is the opposite: the repair will cost\nmore than can be recovered by its contribution to the value of the building. For\nexample, if the foregoing paint job cost $10,000, the deterioration would be\nconsidered incurable.\nFunctional obsolescence. Functional obsolescence occurs when a property has\noutmoded physical or design features which are no longer desirable to current\nusers. If the obsolescence is curable, the cost of replacing or redesigning the\noutmoded feature would be offset by the contribution to overall value, for\nexample, a lack of central air conditioning. If the functional obsolescence is\nincurable, the cost of the cure would exceed the contribution to overall value, for\nexample, a floor layout with a bad traffic pattern that would cost three times as\nmuch as the ending contribution to value.\nEconomic obsolescence. Economic (or external) obsolescence is the loss of\nvalue due to adverse changes in the surroundings of the subject property that\nmake the subject less desirable. Since such changes are usually beyond the\ncontrol of the property owner, economic obsolescence is considered an incurable\nvalue loss. Examples of economic obsolescence include a deteriorating\nneighborhood, a rezoning of adjacent properties, or the bankruptcy of a large\nemployer.\n238 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Steps in the approach The cost approach consists of estimating the value of the land \"as if vacant;\"\nestimating the cost of improvements; estimating and deducting accrued\ndepreciation; and adding the estimated land value to the estimated depreciated\ncost of the improvements.\nExhibit 16.6 Steps in the Cost Approach\n1. Estimate land value.\n2. Estimate reproduction or replacement cost of\nimprovements.\n3. Estimate accrued depreciation.\n4. Subtract accrued depreciation from\nreproduction or replacement cost.\n5. Add land value to depreciated reproduction or\nreplacement cost.\nEstimate land value. To estimate land value, the appraiser uses the sales\ncomparison method: find properties which are comparable to the subject property\nin terms of land and adjust the sale prices of the comparables to account for\ncompetitive differences with the subject property. Common adjustments concern\nlocation, physical characteristics, and time of sale. The indicated values of the\ncomparable properties are used to estimate the land value of the subject. The\nimplicit assumption is that the subject land is vacant (unimproved) and available\nfor the highest and best use.\nEstimate reproduction or replacement cost of improvements. There are\nseveral methods for estimating the reproduction or replacement cost of\nimprovements. These are as follows.\n\uf034 unit comparison method (square-foot method)\nThe appraiser examines one or more new structures that are similar\nto the subject's improvements, determines a cost per unit for the\nbenchmark structures, and multiplies this cost per unit times the\nnumber of units in the subject. The unit of measurement is most\ncommonly denominated in square feet.\n\uf034 unit-in-place method\nThe appraiser uses materials cost manuals and estimates of labor\ncosts, overhead, and builder's profit to estimate the cost of\nconstructing separate components of the subject. The overall cost\nestimate is the sum of the estimated costs of individual\ncomponents.\n\uf034 quantity survey method\nThe appraiser considers in detail all materials, labor, supplies,\noverhead and profit to get an accurate estimate of the actual cost\nto build the improvement.

    "text": "method, this method is used less by appraisers than it is by engineers\nand architects.\n\uf034 cost indexing method\nThe original cost of constructing the improvement is updated by\napplying a percentage increase factor to account for increases in\nnominal costs over time.\nEstimate accrued depreciation. Accrued depreciation is often estimated by the\nstraight-line method, also called the economic age-life method. This method\nassumes that depreciation occurs at a steady rate over the economic life of the\nstructure. Therefore, a property suffers the same incremental loss of value each\nyear.\nThe economic life is the period during which the structure is expected to remain\nuseful in its original use. The cost of the structure is divided by the number of\nyears of economic life to determine an annual amount for depreciation. The\nstraight-line method is primarily relevant to depreciation from physical\ndeterioration.\nSubtract accrued depreciation from reproduction or replacement cost. The\nsum of accrued depreciation from all sources is subtracted from the estimated\ncost of reproducing or replacing the structure. This produces an estimate of the\ncurrent value of the improvements.\nAdd land value to depreciated reproduction or replacement cost. To\ncomplete the cost approach, the estimated value of the land \"as if vacant\" is\nadded to the estimated value of the depreciated reproduction or replacement cost\nof the improvements. This yields the final value estimate for the property by the\ncost approach.\n240 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The approach is based on the principle of\nanticipation: the expected future income stream of a property underlies what an\ninvestor will pay for the property. It is also based on the principle of substitution:\nthat an investor will pay no more for a subject property with a certain income\nstream than the investor would have to pay for another property with a similar\nincome stream.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 241",

Secondly, the income approach relies\non market information about income and expenses, and it can be difficult to find\nsuch information.\nSteps in the approach The income capitalization method consists of estimating annual net operating\nincome from the subject property, then applying a capitalization rate to the\nincome.

When a borrower\ngives a note promising to repay the borrowed money and executes a mortgage on\nthe real estate for which the money is being borrowed as security, the financing\nmethod is called mortgage financing. The term \"mortgage financing\" also applies\nto real estate loans secured by a deed of trust. The process of securing a loan by\npledging a property without giving up ownership of the property is called\nhypothecation.\nStates differ in their interpretation of who owns mortgaged property. Those that\nregard the mortgage as a lien held by the mortgagee (lender) against the property\nowned by the mortgagor (borrower) are called lien-theory states. Those that\nregard the mortgage document as a conveyance of ownership from the mortgagor\nto the mortgagee are called title-theory states. Some states interpret ownership of\nmortgaged property from a point of view that combines aspects of both title and\nlien theory.\nA valid mortgage or trust deed financing arrangement requires\n\uf034 a note as evidence of the debt\n\uf034 the mortgage or trust deed as evidence of the collateral pledge\nNote. In addition to executing a mortgage or trust deed, the borrower signs a\npromissory note for the amount borrowed. The amount of the loan is typically the\ndifference between the purchase price and the down payment. A promissory note\ncreates a personal liability for the borrower to repay the loan.\nChapter 17: Real Estate Finance 249",

On repayment of the\nloan, the borrower receives the title from the trustee in the form of a deed of\nreconveyance.\nThe flow of funds and obligations in a trust deed transaction is as follows:\n250 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The capital amount borrowed, on which interest payments are\ncalculated, is the original loan principal. In an amortizing loan, part of the\nprincipal is repaid periodically along with interest, so that the principal balance\ndecreases over the life of the loan. At any point during the life of a mortgage\nloan, the remaining unpaid principal is called the loan balance, or remaining\nbalance.\nInterest and interest rate. Interest is a charge for the use of the lender's money.\nInterest may be paid in advance at the beginning of the payment period, or in\narrears at the end of the payment period, according to the terms of the note.\nMortgage interest is most commonly paid in arrears. The interest rate is a\npercentage applied to the principal to determine the amount of interest due. The\nrate may be fixed for the term of the loan, or it may be variable, according to the\nterms of the note. A loan with a fixed interest rate is called a fixed-rate loan; a\nloan with a variable interest rate is commonly called an adjustable rate loan.\nBecause the interest rate on a mortgage loan does not reflect the full cost of the\nloan to the borrower, federal law requires a lender on a residential property to\ncompute and disclose an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) that includes other\nfinance charges in addition to the basic interest rate in the calculation.\nChapter 17: Real Estate Finance 251",

    "text": "Many states have laws against usury, which is the charging of excessive interest\nrates on loans. Such states have a maximum rate that is either a flat rate or a\nvariable rate tied to an index such as the prime lending rate.\nPoints. From the point of view of a lender or investor, the amount loaned in a\nmortgage loan is the lender's capital investment, and the interest paid by the\nborrower is the return earned by the invested capital. It is often the case that a\nlender needs to earn a greater return than the interest rate alone provides. For\nexample, a lender may require additional yield on a low-interest VA loan which\nhas an interest rate maximum. In such a case, the lender charges up-front\ndiscount points to make up the difference between the interest rate on the loan\nand the required return. This effectively raises the yield of the loan to the lender.\nA discount point is one percent of the loan amount. Thus, one point on a\n$100,000 loan equals $1,000. The lender charges this as pre-paid interest at\nclosing by funding only the face amount of the loan minus the discount points.\nThe borrower, however, must repay the full loan amount, along with interest\ncalculated on the full amount.\nThe value of one discount point to a lender is usually estimated to be equivalent\nto raising the interest rate on the loan by 1/8%. Thus, a lender has to charge eight\npoints to raise the yield by 1%. If a lender needs to earn 7% on a loan offered at\n6.5%, the number of points necessary would be figured as follows:\n7.0% - 6.5% = .5%\n.5% x 8 (points per 1%) = 4 points\nOn a loan of $100,000, the 4 points would cost the borrower:\n100,000 x .04 = $4,000.\nThe borrower would effectively receive from the lender $96,000, and owe\nprincipal and interest based on $100,000. For tax reasons, it is usually advisable\nfor the borrower to receive the full loan amount from the lender and pay the\npoints in a check which is separate from that used for other closing costs. As pre-\npaid interest, points paid in this way may be deductible on the borrower's income\ntax return for the year of the purchase. The borrower should seek the advice of a\ntax consultant concerning this matter.\nTerm. The loan term is the period of time over which the loan must be repaid. A\n\"30-year loan\" is a loan whose balance must be fully paid off at the end of thirty\nyears. A \"five-year balloon loan\" is a loan whose balance must be paid off at the\nend of five years, although its payments may be calculated on a term of another\nlength, such as fifteen or thirty years. Such a loan is also sometimes described as\na 30-year loan with a five-year \"call.\"\nPayments. The loan term, loan amount, and interest rate combine to determine\nthe periodic payment amount. When these three quantities are known, it is\npossible to identify the periodic payment from a mortgage table or with a\nfinancial calculator. Mortgage payments are usually made on a monthly basis.\nOn an amortizing loan, a portion of the payment goes to repay the loan balance\nin advance, and a portion goes to payment of interest in arrears.\n252 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The monthly payment for this loan will be $2,147. For the first\npayment at the end of the month, the Kings owe interest on $400,000 for the\nmonthly period. At 5%, this amounts to $1,666.67. Since their payment is $2,147\nand the interest charge is $1,666.67, the difference, which is $480.33, is applied to\nan advance payment of principal. The following month, the Kings will pay interest\non the new, smaller loan balance of $399,519.67 ($400,000.00 \u2013 480.33).\nIf a borrower pays more than the scheduled payment amount, the excess is\ncredited to repayment of the principal, which is reduced by the amount of the\nexcess payment. The required minimum payment amount remains constant for\nthe life of the loan, but the loan term can be reduced by this means, thereby also\nreducing the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.\nPromissory note A borrower who executes a promissory note is the maker or payer of the note.\nThe lender is the payee. To be properly executed, all parties who have an interest\nin the property should sign the note. The note sets forth:\n\uf034 the loan amount\n\uf034 the term of the loan\n\uf034 the method and timing of repayment\n\uf034 the interest rate to be paid\n\uf034 the borrower's promise to pay\nThe note may also state that it is payable to the bearer, if used with a deed of\ntrust, or to the mortgagee, if used with a mortgage.

    "text": "Among the major clauses of a typical mortgage are the following.\nPayment of Principal and Interest: Prepayment and Late Charges. The\nborrower must make timely payments according to the terms of the note.\nFunds for Taxes and Insurance. Unless waived by the lender or prohibited by\nlaw, the borrower must make monthly payments to cover taxes and hazard\ninsurance. If applicable, the borrower must also pay flood insurance and\nmortgage insurance installments.\nPeriodic payments of taxes and insurance are held in a reserve fund called the\nescrow account. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) limits the\namount of funds that the lender can require and hold for this purpose.\nThe borrower's monthly payment to the lender for principal and interest is called\nthe P&I payment (principal and interest). The amount which also includes the\nescrow payment is called PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance).\nApplication of Payments. The amount of each payment is applied to various\nitems in order of priority. Unless local law provides otherwise, this order is: 1)\nprepayment charges; 2) escrow; 3) interest; 4) principal; 5) late charges.\nCharges and Liens. The borrower is liable for paying any charges, liens, or other\nexpenses that may have priority over the mortgage or trust instrument.\nHazard or Property Insurance. The borrower must keep the property insured as\nthe lender requires to protect the lender\u2019s collateral. Homeowners\u2019 insurance\npolicies typically provide coverage for losses due to fire, lightning, wind, hail,\nexplosions, glass breakage, smoke, riots, vandalism, theft, and other perils.\nInsurance proceeds, in case of a claim, are applied first to restoring the property,\nor, if that is not feasible, to payment of the debt.\nOccupancy, Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property. The\nborrower must take and maintain occupancy of the property as the borrower's\nprincipal residence according to the lender's requirements. The borrower must not\nuse or neglect the property in such a way as to impair the lender's lien on the\nproperty. This could include using the property for illegal purposes, creating\nhazardous waste on the property, or destroying the improvements.\nProtection of Lender's Rights in the Property. The lender may take actions it\nbelieves are necessary to protect its rights in the property if the borrower's actions\nthreaten them. The costs of these actions would be charged to the borrower, and\nbecome part of the monthly payment.\nMortgage Insurance. The lender may require the borrower to obtain private\nmortgage insurance, or PMI. Mortgage insurance protects the lender against\nloss of a portion of the loan (typically 20-25%) in case of borrower default.\nPrivate mortgage insurance generally applies to loans that are not backed by the\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) or Veterans Administration (VA) and\nthat have a down payment of less than 20% of the property value.\n254 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

If the property is condemned or taken by eminent domain, the\nlender declares a claim on any resulting proceeds.\nBorrower Not Released; Forbearance by Lender Not a Waiver. The lender\nreserves the right to take future action against the borrower for default, even if\nthe lender decides not to take immediate action. If the lender agrees to change the\nterms of the loan, it does not release the borrower from the original liability.\nTransfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. If the borrower\nsells or transfers its interest in the property without the lender's approval, the\nlender may demand immediate and full repayment of the loan balance. This is an\nalienation clause, also known as a due-on-sale clause and a call clause. It allows\nthe lender to prevent the assumption of the mortgage by a buyer if the borrower\nsells the property. The requirement to repay the loan before the scheduled date is\ncalled acceleration.\nBorrower's Right to Reinstate. If the lender holds the borrower in default\nunder the terms of the mortgage and proceeds to enforce its rights under the\ndocument, such as by foreclosing, the borrower has the right to reinstate his or\nher interest by performing certain actions. This usually means paying overdue\nmortgage payments and any other expenses the lender may have incurred in\nprotecting its rights. The clause, also known as a redemption clause, gives the\nborrower a period of time to satisfy obligations and prevent the lender from\nforcing a sale of the property. See foreclosure on page 68 in Chapter Five.\nRelease. The lender agrees to release the mortgage or trust document to the\nborrower when the borrower has paid off the loan and all other sums secured by\nthe document. The release clause, also known as a defeasance clause, may\nspecify that the mortgagee will execute a satisfaction of mortgage (also known\nas release of mortgage and mortgage discharge) to the mortgagor. In the case\nof a deed of trust, the lender as beneficiary requests the trustee to execute a\nrelease deed or deed of reconveyance to the borrower as trustor.

The application must be complete for the lender to consider it. The\nform must be signed and dated by the applicant(s) and delivered to the lending\ninstitution. The initiation of the application process occurs when the lender\nreceives the completed application package from the applicant. Federal law\nrequires the lender to accept all applications and to give applicants notice\nconcerning the disposition of the application. If the lender denies the loan\napplication because of fraudulent information on the application form, the\nborrower has no claim to a refund of the application fee.\nMortgage loan\nunderwriting Loan underwriting is the process of assessing the lender's risk in giving a loan.\nMortgage underwriting includes:\n\uf034 evaluating the borrower's ability to repay the loan\n\uf034 appraising the value of the property offered as security\n\uf034 determining the terms of the loan\nRisk. A lender undertakes a number of risks in lending money. The principal\nrisks are that the borrower will default on repayment of the loan, and that the\nborrower will damage the value of the property as security. In addition, the\nlender runs the risk that, in the event of a foreclosure, the sales proceeds from\nthe property will be insufficient to cover the lender's loss.\nQualification. A lender assesses risks by examining, or qualifying, both\nborrower and property. In qualifying a borrower, an underwriter weighs the\nability of the borrower to repay the loan. This requires an analysis of whether the\nborrower's income, cash resources, creditworthiness, net worth, and employment\nstability meet the lender's standards.\nLoan-to-value ratio, or LTV. In qualifying a property, an underwriter assesses\nthe ability of the property value to cover potential losses. In this evaluation, a\nlender requires that the appraised value of the property be more than adequate to\n256 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "cover the contemplated loan and costs. To protect further against loss, a lender\nwill usually lend only a portion of the property's value. The relationship of the\nloan amount to the property value, expressed as a percentage, is called the loan-\nto-value ratio, or LTV. If the lender's loan to value ratio is 80%, the lender will\nlend only $80,000 on a home appraised at $100,000. The difference between\nwhat the lender will lend and what the borrower must pay for the property is the\namount the borrower must provide in cash as a down payment.\nEven if borrower and property qualify, a lender may, under certain\ncircumstances, seek further protection against risk by requiring the borrower to\nobtain private mortgage insurance. This is frequently the case with loans\nrequiring a relatively small down payment, leading to a high loan-to-value ratio.\nPrivate mortgage insurance. As mentioned earlier, if a loan's LTV ratio is too\nhigh, a lender may require that the borrower purchase private mortgage insurance,\ncommonly called PMI. This insurance secures whatever portion of the loan\namount takes the LTV ratio above the typical ratio limit \u2013 which is usually 80% of\nthe property's value. This protects the lender from the borrower's default \u2013 which\ncan become more likely if the borrower has very little equity in the property.\nTo illustrate, take a $500,000 property with an 90-10% LTV loan on it. At 90%,\nthis loan would be 90% times $500,000, or $450,000. Next, consider that the\nlender requires 20% equity, or an 80-20% LTV. Such an LTV would cap the loan\nlimit at $400,000. In this case, to get this lender to lend $450,000, the borrower\nwould have to purchase PMI to insure the \"top\" portion of the loan, or $50,000.\nWith this PMI safety net, the lender can lend the funds, and the borrower closes\nwith a 90-10 LTV loan.\nIn practice, a borrower who has to obtain PMI must retain the insurance policy\nand continue the premium payments until the LTV ratio on the loan has dropped\nto within acceptable levels, such as the 80-20 level. This happens by the\nproperty's value appreciating as well as the loan balance being paid off over time.\nFinally, if the borrower can assimilate enough funds to pay down the loan balance,\nthe lender will be obligated to drop the PMI requirement, since, as we have seen, a\nprepayment of principal changes the loan-to-value ratio.\nQUALIFYING FOR A MORTGAGE LOAN\nEqual Credit Opportunity Act\nIncome qualification\nLoan constant\nCash qualification\nNet worth\nCredit evaluation\nLoan commitment\nTo qualify for a mortgage loan, a borrower must meet the lender's qualifications\nin terms of income, debt, cash, and net worth.

The lender must rely on eight types of information to\ndetermine that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan:\n1. current income or assets (excluding the value of the mortgaged\nproperty)\n2. current employment status\n3. credit history\n4. monthly payment for the mortgage\n5. monthly payments being made on other loans on the same\nproperty\n6. monthly payments for other mortgage-related expenses\n7. other debts\n8. monthly debt payments compared to monthly income (debt-to-\nincome ratio)\nThe lender cannot use a temporarily low rate (introductory or \u201cteaser\u201d rate) to\ndetermine qualification. For an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM), the highest rate\nthe borrower might have to pay is generally to be used.\n258 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Such residual income requirements vary by\nfamily size, loan amount, and geographical region.\nIncome stability. A lender looks beyond income and debt ratios to assess an\napplicant's income stability. Important factors are:\n\uf034 how long the applicant has been employed at the present job\n\uf034 how frequently and for what reasons the applicant has changed\njobs in the past\n\uf034 how likely secondary income such as bonuses and overtime is to\ncontinue on a regular basis\n\uf034 how educational level, training and skills, age, and type of\noccupation may affect the continuation of the present income\nlevel in the future.\nLoan constant A loan constant is a pre-calculated, unchanging number that relates the principal\nand interest payment amount of a loan to the amount of the loan at a given\ninterest rate and term.\nChapter 17: Real Estate Finance 261",

If some of a borrower's cash for\nthe down payment comes as a gift from a relative or friend, a lender may require\na gift letter from the donor stating the amount of the gift and lack of any\nrequirement to repay the gift. On the other hand, if someone is lending an\napplicant a portion of the down payment with a provision for repayment, a lender\nwill consider this another debt obligation and adjust the debt ratio accordingly.\nThis can lower the amount a lender is willing to lend.\nNet worth An applicant's net worth shows a lender the depth of the applicant's cash\nreserves, the value and liquidity of assets, and the extent to which assets\nexceed liabilities. These facts are important to a lender as an indication of the\napplicant's ability to sustain debt payment in the event of loss of employment.\nCredit evaluation Credit report and credit score.

Credit scoring is a computer-based method\nof assigning a numerical value to an applicant's credit. The credit score is a\nstatistical prediction of a borrower's likelihood of defaulting on a loan.\nLoan commitment When a lender's underwriters have qualified an applicant and the lender has\ndecided to offer the loan, the lender gives the applicant a written notice of the\nagreement to lend under specific terms. This written promise is the loan\ncommitment.

This money may become available through the process of\nintermediation, in which funds on deposit with financial institutions are loaned\nout to borrowers, or disintermediation, in which the owners of the savings invest\ntheir money directly by making loans or other investments. Government actions\nand investor activities affect the supply of money for mortgage loans and\nencourage or discourage the market for mortgage loans as an investment.\nSupply and demand\nfor money Money is a limited commodity subject to the effects of supply and demand. The\nfederal government's monetary policy controls the supply of money in order to\nachieve the country's economic goals. An excessive supply of money usually\ncauses interest rates to fall and consumer prices to rise. Conversely, an excessive\ndemand for money, such as for mortgage loans, causes interest rates to rise and\nprices to fall. Regulation of the money supply addresses these fluctuations with\nthe aim to control and limit wide swings in the supply and demand cycle. These\nefforts, in turn, help to buffer the economy from severe inflationary or\nrecessionary trends.\nRegulating the money supply. The Federal Reserve System regulates the money\nsupply by means of three methods:\n\uf034 selling or re-purchasing government securities, primarily\nTreasury bills\n\uf034 changing the reserve requirement for member banks. The\nreserve is a percentage of depositors' funds that banks and other\nregulated financial institutions may not lend out.\n\uf034 changing the interest rate, or discount rate, the system charges\nmember institutions for borrowing funds from the Federal\nReserve System central banks\nWhen the Federal Reserve sells Treasury bills, the money paid for the securities\nis removed from the economy's money supply. Conversely, when it repurchases\nTreasury bills, the cash paid out to investors puts money back into the economy.\nThe second control, regulating reserve requirements, effectively restricts how\nmuch money banks can put into the economy through the disbursement of loans.\nWhen the Federal Reserve raises reserve requirements, banks have less money to\nlend, decreasing the money supply. When the Fed lowers reserve requirements,\nbanks have more money to lend, increasing the money supply.\nThe third control, and perhaps the most effective, is regulation of the discount\nrate which member banks must pay to borrow money. If the discount rate goes\nup, it becomes more cost-prohibitive to borrow. Therefore the money supply\ntightens. If the discount rate is lowered, banks have an incentive to borrow more\nmoney to lend to customers.\nThe primary\nmortgage market The primary mortgage market consists of lenders who originate mortgage\nloans directly to borrowers. Primary mortgage market lenders include:\n\uf034 savings and loans\n\uf034 commercial banks\n\uf034 mutual savings banks\n268 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Rather, they are instrumental in procuring\nborrowers for primary mortgage lenders.\nThe primary lender assumes the initial risk of the long-term investment in the\nmortgage loan. Primary lenders sometimes also service the loan until it is paid\noff. Servicing loans entails collecting the borrower's periodic payments,\nmaintaining and disbursing funds in escrow accounts for taxes and insurance,\nsupervising the borrower's performance, and releasing the mortgage on\nrepayment. In many cases, primary lenders employ mortgage servicing\ncompanies, which service loans for a fee.\nPortfolio lenders. A primary mortgage market lender may or may not sell its\nloans into the secondary market. Many lenders originate loans for the purpose of\nretaining the investments in their own loan portfolio. These loans are referred to\nas portfolio loans, and lenders originating loans for their own portfolio are called\nportfolio lenders. Portfolio lenders are less restricted by the standards and forms\nimposed on other lenders by secondary market organizations. In retaining their\nportfolio loans, portfolio lenders may vary underwriting criteria and hold\nindependent standards for down payment requirements and the condition of the\ncollateral.\nThe secondary\nmortgage market Lenders, investors and government agencies that buy loans already originated by\nsomeone else, or originate loans indirectly through someone else, constitute the\nsecondary mortgage market.\nSecondary mortgage market organizations include:\n\uf034 Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie\nMae)\n\uf034 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, or Freddie\nMac)\n\uf034 Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie\nMae)\n\uf034 investment firms that assemble loans into packages and sell\nsecurities based on the pooled mortgages\n\uf034 life insurance companies\n\uf034 pension funds\n\uf034 primary market institutions who also invest as secondary lenders\nSecondary mortgage market organizations buy pools of mortgages from primary\nlenders and sell securities backed by these pooled mortgages to investors. By\nselling securities, the secondary market brings investor money into the mortgage\nmarket. By purchasing loans from primary lenders, the secondary market returns\nfunds to the primary lenders, thereby enabling the primary lender to originate\nmore mortgage loans.\nChapter 17: Real Estate Finance 269",

    "text": "TYPES OF REAL ESTATE LOANS\nConventional loans\nFHA-insured loans\nVA-guaranteed loans\nCommon loan structures\nSeller financing\nSpecial-purpose loans\nConventional loans A conventional mortgage loan is a permanent long-term loan that is not FHA-\ninsured or VA-guaranteed. Market rates usually determine the interest rate on\nthe loan. Because of the lack of insurance or guarantee by a government\nagency, the risk to a lender is greater for a conventional loan than for a non-\nconventional loan. This risk is usually reflected in higher interest rates and\nstricter requirements for the down payment and the borrower's income\nqualification. At the same time, conventional loans allow greater flexibility in\nfees, rates, and terms than do insured and guaranteed loans.\nThe primary sources of conventional loans are banks and savings and loan\nassociations. Other conventional lenders include credit unions, life insurance\ncompanies, pension funds, mortgage bankers, and private individuals.\nVarious types of lenders specialize in mortgage lending for specific purposes\nand type of borrower, such as commercial, construction, or single-family\nresidential loans.\nFHA-insured loans The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is an agency of the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (HUD). It does not lend money, but insures\npermanent long-term loans made by others. The lender must be approved by the\nFHA, and the borrower must meet certain FHA qualifications. In addition, the\nproperty used to secure the loan must meet FHA standards. The FHA insures that\nthe lender will not suffer significant loss in the case of borrower default. To\nprovide this security, FHA provides insurance and charges the borrower an\ninsurance premium. FHA loans typically have a higher loan-to-value ratio than\nconventional loans, enabling a borrower to make a smaller down payment.\nThe basic FHA-insured loan program is the Title II, Section 203(b) program for\nloans on one- to four-family residential properties. Among the features of this\nprogram are the following.\nFHA mortgage insurance. The FHA determines how much mortgage insurance\nmust be provided and charges the borrower an appropriate mortgage insurance\npremium (MIP). The initial premium is payable at closing or is added to the\nborrower's loan balance and financed. Further annual premiums are charged\nmonthly. The amount of the premium varies according to the loan term and the\napplicable loan-to-value ratio.\nBorrower default. The FHA reimburses the lender for losses due to default by\nthe borrower, including costs of foreclosure.\nAppraisal. The property must be appraised by an FHA-approved appraiser. The\nproperty must also meet the FHA's standards for type and quality of construction,\nneighborhood quality, and other features.\n272 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Maximum loan amount. The FHA has set maximum loan amounts for over 80\nregions. Borrowers within a region are limited to the loan ceiling amount in effect\nfor the region. In addition, the maximum loan amount is restricted by the loan-to-\nvalue ratios in effect. The maximum FHA-backed loan a borrower can obtain will\nbe the lesser of the regional ceiling amount or the amount dictated by the loan-to-\nvalue standard. Calculations are based on the lesser of sale price or appraised\nvalue.\nDown payment requirement. The minimum down payment for an FHA-backed\nloan is based on the lower of the appraised value or the sales price. The present\nrequirement for single-family residential loans is 3.5%.\nMaximum loan term. Thirty years is the maximum length of the repayment\nperiod.\nPrepayment privilege. The borrower has the right to pay off the loan at any time\nwithout penalty, provided the lender is given prior notice. The lender may charge\nup to 30 days' interest if the borrower provides less than 30 days' notice.\nAssumability. FHA-backed loans on owner-occupied properties are assumable if\nthe buyer is qualified. Lenders and borrowers should check with FHA for current\nrequirements.\nInterest rate. The lender and borrower negotiate the interest rate on an FHA-\nbacked loan without any involvement by FHA.\nPoints, fees and costs. The lender may charge discount points, a loan origination\nfee, and other such charges. These may be paid by buyer or seller. However, if\nthe seller pays more than a specified percentage of the costs normally paid by a\nbuyer, the FHA may regard these as sales concessions and lower the sales price\non which the loan insurance amount is based.\nIn addition to Section 203(b) loan programs, FHA offers insurance coverage for\nother loan products. These include:\n\uf034 home improvement loans\n\uf034 subsidized loans for low- and middle-income families\n\uf034 loans for condominiums\n\uf034 loans for multi-family projects\n\uf034 graduated-payment loans\n\uf034 adjustable-rate loans\nVA-guaranteed\nloans The Department of Veterans Affairs (formerly Veterans Administration) offers\nloan guarantees to qualified veterans. The VA, like the FHA, does not lend\nmoney except in certain areas where other financing is not generally available.\nInstead, the VA partially guarantees permanent long-term loans originated by\nVA-approved lenders on properties that meet VA standards. The VA's guarantee\nenables lenders to issue loans with higher loan-to-value ratios than would\notherwise be possible. The interest rate on a VA-guaranteed loan is usually lower\nthan one on a conventional loan. The borrower does not pay any premium for the\nloan guarantee, but does pay a VA funding fee at closing.\nChapter 17: Real Estate Finance 273",

The property must be appraised by a VA-approved appraiser. The VA\nissues a Certificate of Reasonable Value which creates a maximum value on\nwhich the VA-guaranteed portion of the loan will be based. The property must\nmeet certain VA specifications.\nDown payment requirement. The VA usually requires no down payment,\nalthough the lender may require one.\nMaximum loan amount. The VA does not cap the loan amount, but it does limit\nthe liability it can assume, which usually influences the amount an institution will\nlend. The amount a qualified veteran with full entitlement can borrow without\nmaking a downpayment determines the practical loan limits. This amount varies\nby county. The basic entitlement available to each eligible veteran is $36,000.\nLenders will generally lend a maximum of 4 times that amount without a down\npayment if the veteran is fully qualified and the property appraises for the asking\nprice.\nA veteran must apply for a Certificate of Eligibility to find out how much the VA\nwill guarantee in a particular situation.\nMaximum loan term. The maximum loan term for one- to four-family residences\nis 30 years. For loans secured by farms, the maximum loan term is 40 years.\nPrepayment privilege.

Usually, the person\nassuming the loan must have VA eligibility, and the assumption may have to be\napproved by the VA.\nInterest rate. Lender and borrower negotiate the interest rate for all VA-insured\nloans.\nPoints, fees and costs. The lender may charge discount points, origination fees,\nand other reasonable costs. These may be paid by seller (with some limits) or\nbuyer, but may not be financed. The VA funding fee, however, may be included\nin the loan amount. The funding fee is a percentage of the loan amount which\nvaries based on the type of loan, military category, whether the loan is a first-time\nloan, and whether there is a down payment.\nOther VA programs. In addition to insuring loans to veterans, the VA may\ninsure loans for lenders who set up a special account with the VA. The VA may\nalso actually lend money directly when an eligible veteran cannot find other\nmortgage money locally.\nCommon loan\nstructures Variations in the structure of interest rate, term, payments, and principal payback\nproduce a number of commonly recognized loan types. Among these are the\nfollowing.\nAmortizing loan. Amortization provides for gradual repayment of principal and\npayment of interest over the term of the loan. The borrower's periodic payments\nto the lender include a portion for interest and a portion for principal. In a fully\namortizing mortgage, the principal balance is zero at the end of the term.

    "text": "partially amortizing loan, the payments are not sufficient to retire the debt. At the\nend of the loan term, there is still a principal balance to be paid off.\nNegatively amortized loan. Negative amortization causes the loan\nbalance to increase over the term. This occurs if the borrower's periodic\npayment is insufficient to cover the interest owed for the period. The\nlender adds the amount of unpaid interest to the borrower's loan balance.\nTemporary negative amortization occurs on graduated payment loans,\nand may occur on an adjustable rate mortgage.\nAdjustable and fixed rate loans. Loans may have fixed or variable rates of\ninterest over the loan term. Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) allow the lender\nto change the interest rate at specified intervals and by a specified amount.\nFederal regulations place limits, called rate caps, on incremental interest rate\nincreases and on the total amount by which the rate may be increased over the\nloan term.\nSenior and junior loans. When there are multiple loans on a single property,\nthere is an order of priority in the liens which the mortgages create. The first, or\nsenior, loan generally has priority over any subsequent loans. Second loans are\nriskier than first loans because the senior lender will be satisfied first in case of\ndefault. Therefore, interest rates on second mortgages are generally higher than\non first mortgages.\nFixed and graduated payment loans. Loans may have variable payment\namounts over the term of the loan, or a single fixed payment amount. With a\ngraduated payment mortgage, the payments at the beginning of the loan term are\nnot sufficient to amortize the loan fully, and unpaid interest is added to the\nprincipal balance. Payments are later adjusted to a level that will fully amortize\nthe loan's increased balance over the remaining loan term.\nInterest-only loan. In an interest-only loan, periodic payments over the loan\nterm apply only to interest owed, not to principal. At the end of the term, the full\nbalance must be paid off in a lump-sum, \"balloon\" payment. Since these loans\nhave no periodic principal payback, their monthly payments are smaller than\namortizing loans for the same amount at the same rate of interest.\nBuydown loan. A buydown loan entails a prepayment of interest on a loan. The\nprepayment effectively lowers the interest rate and the periodic payments for the\nborrower. Buydowns typically occur in a circumstance where a builder wants to\nmarket a new development to a buyer who cannot quite qualify for the necessary\nloan at market rates. By \"buying down\" a borrower's mortgage, a builder enables\nthe borrower to obtain the loan. The builder may then pass the costs of the\nbuydown through to the buyer in the form of a higher purchase price.\nSeller financing The seller may provide some or all of the financing for the buyer's purchase. Some\nof the most common methods of seller financing are purchase money mortgages,\nincluding the wraparound, and the contract for deed.\nPurchase money mortgage. With a purchase money mortgage, the borrower\ngives a mortgage and note to the seller to finance some or all of the purchase\nprice of the property. The seller in this case is said to \"take back\" a note, or to\nChapter 17: Real Estate Finance 275",

    "text": "\"carry paper,\" on the property. Purchase money mortgages may be either senior\nor junior liens.\nWraparound. In a wraparound loan arrangement, the seller receives a junior\nmortgage from the buyer, and uses the buyer's payments to make the payments on\nthe original first mortgage. A wraparound enables the buyer to obtain financing\nwith a minimum cash investment. It also potentially enables the seller to profit\nfrom any difference between a lower interest rate on the senior loan and a higher\nrate on the wraparound loan. A wraparound is possible only if the senior\nmortgagee allows it.\nContract for deed. Under a contract for deed arrangement, the seller retains title\nand the buyer receives possession and equitable title while making payments\nunder the terms of the contract. The seller conveys title when the contract has\nbeen fully performed.\nSpecial-purpose\nloans Home equity loan. The ostensible purpose of this type of loan is to obtain funds\nfor home improvement. Structurally, the home equity loan is a junior mortgage\nsecured by the homeowner's equity, equity in general being the portion of the\nproperty\u2019s value actually owned by the homeowner, expressed as the difference\nbetween the property\u2019s market value and all loan balances outstanding on the\nproperty.\nFor some lenders, the maximum home equity loan amount is based on the\ndifference between the property's appraised value and the maximum loan-to-\nvalue ratio the lender allows on the property, inclusive of all existing mortgage\nloans. Thus if a home is appraised at $500,000 and the lender's maximum LTV is\n80%, the lender will lend a total of $400,000. If the owner's existing mortgage\nbalance is $325,000, the owner would qualify for a $75,000 home equity loan.\nPackage loan. A package loan finances the purchase of real estate and personal\nproperty. For example, a package loan might finance a furnished condominium,\ncomplete with all fixtures and decor.\nConstruction loan. A construction loan finances construction of improvements.\nThis type of loan is paid out by the lender in installments linked to stages of the\nconstruction process. The loan is usually interest-only, and the borrower makes\nperiodic payments based on the amount disbursed so far. As short-term, high-risk\nfinancing, the interest rates are usually higher than those for long-term financing.\nThe borrower is expected to find permanent (\"take out\") financing elsewhere to\npay off the temporary loan when construction is complete.\nBridge loan. A bridge, or gap, loan is used to cover a gap in financing between\nshort-term construction financing and long-term permanent financing. For\ninstance, a developer may have difficulty finding a long-term lender to take out\nthe construction lender. However, as the construction loan is expensive and must\nbe paid off as soon as possible, the developer may find an interim lender who will\npay off the construction loan but not agree to a long-term loan.\nParticipation loan. In a participation loan, the lender participates in the income\nand/or equity of the property, in return for giving the borrower more favorable\nloan terms than would otherwise be justified. For instance, the borrower makes\n276 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The long-term lender pays off the\nbalance on the construction loan when the project is completed, leaving the\nborrower with a long-term loan under more favorable terms than the construction\nloan offered.\nReverse annuity. In a reverse annuity mortgage, a homeowner pledges the\nequity in the home as security for a loan which is paid out in regular monthly\namounts over the term of the loan. The homeowner, in effect, is able to convert\nthe equity to cash without losing ownership and possession.\nBlanket.

With any investment, one wants the\noriginal investment to grow, without losing it. This idea is called conservation of\ncapital. Unfortunately, no investment is truly secure. External conditions change,\nand the investment itself can change. Even if you do nothing with it, its value\ndoes not remain constant.\nRisk versus return. The general rule in investments is that the safer the\ninvestment, the more slowly it gains in value. The more you want it to gain, and\nthe more quickly, the more you must risk losing it. How much do you want to\nearn, and how much are you willing to risk to earn it? Reward in investing\ncorresponds directly to the degree of risk.\nManagement. Another aspect of investment is the amount of attention you must\npay to it to make it work. You can deposit cash in a passbook account and forget\nabout it. You can use your cash to buy a business and then run the business\nyourself to make your asset grow and earn. How much do you want to be\ninvolved in managing your investment?\nLiquidity. The issue of exchangeability is an important one in investment. How\neasy is it to recover your invested resource, without loss, and exchange it for\nanother one that you want? If there is a market for the type of resource you have-\nother people want to buy and sell it for themselves-- your investment is liquid.\nThe most liquid form of financial investment is generally cash, since cash is itself\na medium of exchange and people always want it. A more illiquid investment is\none which takes a long time to exchange for something you prefer to own. How\nlong are you willing to wait to recover your invested resource and its earnings?\nChapter 18: Real Estate Investment 281",

    "text": "Rewards The basic aim of financial investment is to increase one's wealth, to add value to\nwhat you have. This can occur in several ways.\nIncome. An investment can generate income in some way on a periodic basis.\nYou may consume this cash, spending it for goods and services that, when used\nup, have no further value. Or, you may use the cash to put into another\ninvestment.\nAppreciation. Your invested asset itself may gain value over time because of an\nincrease in market demand for it. When you sell or exchange it for something\nelse you prefer to have, you get more than you originally put into the investment.\nLeverage. You may pledge the value of your resource to borrow funds in order\nto make an investment that is larger than your own resource permits you to do\ndirectly. The small resource is used as a lever to make a larger investment, and\nthus increases your opportunity to benefit from income, appreciation, and the\nother rewards of investment.\nTax benefits. Some investments receive treatment under tax laws that enables the\ninvestor to reduce or defer the amount of tax owed. Tax dollars you don't have to\npay are dollars you have available for some other use, such as consuming or\nfurther investing.\nRisks Investment risks come from a variety of general sources, including the market,\nbusiness operations, the value of money, and changes in the interest rate.\nMarket risk. Changes in the demand for your invested resource may cause your\ninvestment to lose value and to become illiquid.\nBusiness risk. Changes in the operation of a business with which your\ninvestment is connected may reduce or eliminate the income- and appreciation-\nearning capacity of your investment.\nPurchasing power risk. Changes in the value of money as an exchange medium,\nsuch as through inflation, may decrease the practical value of your invested\nresource.\nFinancial risk. Changes in financial markets, particularly in interest rates, may\nreduce the value of your investment by making it less desirable to others and by\nmaking it more expensive for you to maintain.\nAn investment may fail to produce any or all of the desired investment rewards\nlisted earlier. The expected income may not be realized. The invested asset may\nfail to appreciate as expected. It may even decline in value. Perhaps even worse,\nyou may be called on to add to the investment just to keep it in place. Your\nleverage may turn against you, becoming negative leverage. This is the situation\nwhen your cost of borrowing funds to make the investment becomes greater than\nthe income the investment returns to you. Finally, your expectation of a tax\nadvantage may be disappointed. Tax laws are constantly changing.\n282 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Types of\ninvestments Four of the most important types of investment are investments in money, equity,\ndebt, and real estate.\nMoney investments. A money investment is one in which the basic form of the\ninvestment remains money. Examples are: deposit accounts, certificates of\ndeposit, money funds, and annuities. The basic reward from a money investment\ncomes in the form of interest. Money investments are relatively safe, with\ncorrespondingly conservative rates of return.\nDebt investments. A debt investment is one in which an investor buys a debt\ninstrument. Examples are bonds, notes, mortgages, and bond mutual funds. The\nbasic reward comes in the form of interest. Debt investments are usually riskier\nthan money investments and less risky than stocks or real estate.\nEquity investments. An equity investment is one in which an investor buys an\nownership interest in a business concern. Examples are stocks and stock mutual\nfunds. The basic rewards come in the form of dividends and appreciation of share\nvalue. Equity investments are generally riskier than money and debt investments.\nReal estate investments. A real estate investment is one in which an investor\nbuys real estate for its investment benefits rather than primarily for its utility. It\nmay have the features of both an equity and debt investment, depending on the\ntype of real estate involved and numerous other factors, such as the type of\ninterest one owns. A real estate investor may invest in an income-producing\nproperty or a non-income producing property.\n\uf034 Non-income property\na residential property used as the investor's primary residence.\nThe basic reward, beyond the enjoyment of use, comes in the\nform of appreciation. There may also be tax benefits, depending\non how the purchase is financed.\n\uf034 Income property\na property owned specifically for the investment rewards it\noffers. Examples are multi-family residential properties, retail\nstores, industrial properties, and office buildings. Rewards come\nin any or all of the forms mentioned earlier: income,\nappreciation, leverage and tax advantages.\nChapter 18: Real Estate Investment 283",

    "text": "REAL ESTATE AS AN INVESTMENT\nRisk and reward\nIlliquidity\nManagement requirements\nReal estate investments participate in the general risks and rewards of all\ninvestments. However, real estate investments are often complex. They are also\ndistinguished by their lack of liquidity and by the amount of management they\nrequire. In addition, each investor has specific aims and circumstances that affect\nthe viability of any particular real estate investment for that individual. Licensees\nwho lack expertise in the area of real estate investment analysis should refer\npotential investors to a competent advisor. Nevertheless, a licensee should be\nfamiliar with the basics of real estate as an investment.\nRisk and reward Capital put into real estate is always subject to the full range of risk factors:\nmarket changes, income shortfalls, negative leverage, tax law changes, and poor\noverall return.\nMarket demand for a specific type of property can decline. For example, a\nbusiness district's retailers may vacate stores in an area in order to obtain better\nspace in a new shopping center. Market downturns leave the income property\ninvestor with an unmarketable property or one which can only be re-leased at a\nloss of some portion of the original investment. Thus the expected reward from\nincome or appreciation may never be obtained.\nAnother risk of the investment property is the cost of development or operation.\nIf start-up costs or ongoing operating costs exceed rental income, the owner must\ndip into additional capital resources to maintain the investment until its income\nincreases. If income does not rise, or if costs do not decline, the investor can\nsimply run out of money.\nLeverage is a constant risk in real estate investment. If the property fails to\ngenerate sufficient revenue, the costs of borrowed money can bankrupt the\nowner, just as development and operating costs can. Investors often overlook the\nfact that leverage only works when the yield on the investment exceeds the costs\nof borrowed funds.\nTax law is an ongoing risk in long-term real estate investment. If the investor's\ntax circumstances change, or if the tax laws do, the investor may end up paying\nmore capital gains and income taxes than planned, undermining the return on the\ninvestment. An investor needs to consider carefully the value of such potential\ntax benefits as deductions for mortgage interest, tax losses, deferred gains,\nexemptions, and tax credits for certain types of real estate investment.\nAnother consideration is opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is the return that an\ninvestor could earn on capital invested with minimal risk. If the real estate\ninvestment, with all its attendant risk, cannot yield a greater return than an\n284 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Despite all the risks, real estate remains a popular\ninvestment, because, historically, the rewards have outweighed the risks. Real\nestate has proven to be relatively resistant to adverse inflationary trends that have\nhurt money, debt, and stock investments. In addition, real estate has proven to be\na viable investment in view of the economy's continued expansion over the last\nfifty years.\nIlliquidity Compared with other classes of investment, real estate is relatively illiquid. Even\nin the case of liquidating a single-family residence, one can expect a marketing\nperiod of at least several months in most markets. In addition, it takes time for the\nbuyer to obtain financing and to complete all the other phases of closing the\ntransaction. Commercial and investment properties can take much longer,\ndepending on market conditions, leases, construction, permitting, and a host of\nother factors. The investor who is in a hurry to dispose of such an investment can\nexpect to receive a lower sales price than may be ideal. Compare this with the\nease of drawing money out of a bank account or selling a stock.\nManagement\nrequirements Real estate tends to require a high degree of investor involvement in management\nof the investment. Even raw land requires some degree of maintenance to\npreserve its value: drainage, fencing, payment of taxes, and periodic inspection,\nto name a few tasks. Improved properties often require extensive management,\nincluding repairs, maintenance, onsite leasing, tenant relations, security, and\nfiscal management.\nREAL ESTATE INVESTMENT ENTITIES\nDirect\nSyndicate and partnership\nReal Estate Investment Trust\nReal Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit\nDirect Individuals, corporations or other investor entities may invest as active investors\nin a property by buying it directly and taking responsibility for managing and\noperating the property.\nSyndicate and\npartnership A real estate syndicate is a group of investors who combine resources to buy,\ndevelop, and/or operate a property.\nA general partnership is a syndicate in which all members participate equally\nin managing the investment and in the profits or losses it generates. The group\ndesignates a trustee to hold title in the name of the syndicate.\nA limited partnership is a syndicate in which a general partner organizes,\noperates and is generally responsible for the partnership's interests in the property.\nLimited partners invest money in the partnership but do not participate in\noperating the property. These limited partners are passive investors.\nChapter 18: Real Estate Investment 285",

    "text": "Real Estate\nInvestment Trust\n(REIT) In a Real Estate Investment Trust, investors buy certificates in the trust, and the\ntrust in turn invests in mortgages or real estate. Investors receive income\naccording to the number of shares they own. A trust must receive at least 75% of\nits income from real estate to qualify as a REIT, and if certain other conditions\nare met, the trust does not have to pay any corporate income tax.\nReal Estate Mortgage\nInvestment Conduit\n(REMIC) A REMIC is a kind of partnership entity formed to hold a fixed pool of\nmortgages that are secured by real property. The entity issues two kinds of\ninterest. Holders of residual interests are treated, for tax purposes, as partners.\nHolders of regular interests are regarded as owning debt instruments. Income (or\nloss) received by regular or residual interest holders is treated as portfolio\nincome or loss, and is not included in determining losses from passive activities.\nTAXATION OF REAL ESTATE\nINVESTMENTS\nTaxable income\nCost recovery\nGain on sale\nInterest\nPassive activities\nReal estate investments are taxed on the income they produce and on the increase\nin value, or gain, when the investment is sold. These forms of taxation are\ndistinct from the ad valorem taxation of real estate.\nTaxable Income Taxable income from investment real estate is the gross income received minus\nany expenses, deductions or exclusions that current tax law allows. Taxable\nincome from real estate is added to the investor's other income and taxed at the\ninvestor's marginal tax rate. The \"Investment Analysis of an Income Property\"\nsection below gives details.\nCost recovery Cost recovery, or depreciation, allows the owner of income property to deduct a\nportion of the property's value from gross income each year over the life of the\nasset. The \"life of the asset\" and the deductible portion are defined by law. In\ntheory, the owner recovers the full cost of the investment if it is held to the end of\nthe asset's economic life as defined by the Internal Revenue Service. At the time\nof selling the asset, the accumulated cost recovery is subtracted from the\ninvestment's original value as part of determining the taxable capital gain.\nCost recovery is allowed only for income properties and that portion of a non-\nincome property which is used to produce income. It applies only to\nimprovements. Land cannot be depreciated. The part of a property which can be\ndepreciated is called the depreciable basis.\n286 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The basic annual deduction for such property is 3.636%,\nwith adjustments for the month of the taxable year in which the property was\nplaced in service. Non-residential income properties placed in service after 1994\nare depreciated over a period of 39 years (basic annual percentage is 2.564%).\nThe proper method of depreciation should be determined in consultation with a\nqualified tax advisor.\nGain on sale When real estate, whether non-income or income, is sold, a taxable event occurs.\nIf the sale proceeds exceed the original cost of the investment, subject to some\nadjustments, there is a capital gain that is subject to tax. If the sales proceeds are\nless than the original cost with adjustments, there is a capital loss.\n1031 (Starker) exchange. An investor can sometimes defer the reporting of gain\nor loss, and, hence, taxation of gain, by participating in an exchange of like-kind\nassets. The legislation that deals with like-kind exchanges is contained in Section\n1031 of the IRS code. These tax-deferred exchanges are sometimes called Section\n1031 exchanges and Starker exchanges, named for an investor who won a case\nagainst the IRS.\nTo qualify under Section 1031, there must have been a legitimate exchange of the\nassets involved. The property being transferred must have been held for\nproductive use in a trade or business or held as an investment and must be\nexchanged for property that will also be used in a trade or business or be held as\nan investment. Tax on gain is deferred until the investment or business property\nis sold and not exchanged.\nInterest Mortgage interest incurred by loans to buy, build, or materially improve a\nprimary or secondary residence is deductible from gross income, subject to\nlimitations based on the loan amount and when it was incurred . The interest on a\nhome equity loan may be deducted only if the loan is used to \u201cbuy, build or\nsubstantially improve\u201d the home that secures the loan. Principal payments on a\nloan are not deductible. Licensees should consult the latest IRS publications for\ncurrent rules on mortgage interest deduction.\nFor income properties that are held as investments, interest on debts incurred to\nfinance the investment is deductible as investment interest up to the amount of\nnet income received from the property.\nPassive activities Passive activities are business activities in which the taxpayer does not materially\nparticipate. Included are interests in limited partnerships and rental activities.\nLosses from such activities may be used to offset income from other passive\nactivities. Passive losses, with certain limitations, may be carried forward to\nfuture years or accumulated and deducted from capital gain at the time of sale.\nChapter 18: Real Estate Investment 287",

The\nanalysis includes costs, income, taxation, appreciation, and return.\nA property acquired and used as a primary residence is an example of a non-\nincome property. If a portion of a residence is used for business (i.e., a home\noffice), this portion only may be treated as an income property for tax purposes.\nSince, by definition, a non-income property does not generate income, its value\nas an investment must come from one or more of the other sources: appreciation,\nleverage, or tax benefits.\nAppreciation Appreciation is the increase in value of an asset over time. A simple way to\nestimate appreciation on a primary residence is to subtract the price originally\npaid from the estimated current market value:\nCurrent value - original price = total appreciation\nFor example, if a house was bought for $300,000 and its estimated market value\nnow is $400,000, it has appreciated by $100,000.\nOriginal price: $300,000\nCurrent market value: $400,000\nTotal appreciation: $100,000\nTotal appreciation can be stated as a percentage increase over the original price by\ndividing the estimated total appreciation by the original price.\nThe house in the last example has appreciated by 33%:\n(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b)\n=% \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\n100,000\n=33%\n300,000\nTo estimate the percentage of annual appreciation, divide the percent appreciated\nby the number of years the house has been owned:\n% \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\n=% \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\n288 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Furthermore, depreciation\nis not allowed for non-income properties. Consult IRS publications for current\nconditions and limitations for mortgage interest deductibility.\nTax liability The seller of a principal residence may owe tax on capital gain that results from\nthe sale. The IRS defines gain on the sale of a home as amount realized from the\nsale minus the adjusted basis of the home sold.\nAmount realized. The amount realized, also known as net proceeds from sale,\nis expressed by the formula:\nsale price\n- costs of sale\namount realized\nThe sale price is the total amount the seller receives for the home. This includes\nmoney, notes, mortgages or other debts the buyer assumes as part of the sale.\nCosts of sale include brokerage commissions, relevant advertising, legal fees,\nseller-paid points and other closing costs. Certain fixing-up expenses, as\ndiscussed further below, can be deducted from the amount realized to derive an\nadjusted sale price for the purpose of postponing taxation on gain.\nFor example, Larry and Mary sold their home for $350,000. Their selling costs,\nincluding the commission they paid Broker Betty and amounts paid to inspectors,\na surveyor, and the title company, amounted to ten percent of the selling price, or\n$35,000. The amount they realized from the sale was therefore $315,000.\nAdjusted basis. Basis is a measurement of how much is invested in the property\nfor tax purposes. Assuming that the property was acquired through purchase, the\nbeginning basis is the cost of acquiring the property. Cost includes cash and debt\nobligations, and such other settlement costs as legal and recording fees, abstract\nfees, surveys, charges for installing utilities, transfer taxes, title insurance, and\nany other amounts the buyer pays for the seller.\nThe beginning basis is increased or decreased by certain types of expenditures\nmade while the property is owned. Basis is increased by the cost of capital\nimprovements made to the property. Assessments for local improvements such\nas roads and sidewalks also increase the basis. Examples of capital improvements\nare: putting on an addition, paving a driveway, replacing a roof, adding central air\nconditioning, and rewiring the home.\nChapter 18: Real Estate Investment 289",

Vacancy and collection\nloss is rental income lost because of vacancies or tenants' failure to pay rent.\nEffective rental income is the potential income adjusted for these losses. To that\nis added any other income the property generates, such as from laundry or\nparking charges, to obtain gross operating income. Operating expenses paid by\nthe landlord include such items as utilities and maintenance. These are deducted\nfrom gross operating income. Some owners also set aside a cash reserve each\nyear to build up a fund for capital replacements in the future, for example, to\nreplace a roof or a furnace. Cash reserves are not deductible for tax purposes until\nspent as deductible repairs or maintenance. The remainder is net operating\nincome (NOI). When the annual amount paid for debt service, including\nprincipal and interest, is subtracted, the remainder is the pre-tax cash flow.\nFor instance, a small office building of 3,500 square feet rents at $20 per square\nfoot. If fully rented, the annual rental income would be $70,000. Historically, the\nproperty averages $4,200 in vacancy and collection losses. Equipment rental will\nprovide an additional $2,000 per year in income. The owner will have to pay\noperating expenses amounting to ten dollars per square foot, or $35,000 per year.\nThe owner sets aside one dollar per square foot, or $3,500 per year, for reserves.\nThe owner financed the purchase of the building with a loan that requires annual\ndebt service in the amount of $20,000.

Real estate\nproperty taxes are imposed by \"taxing entities\" or \"taxing districts\" at county and\nlocal levels of government.\nThere are no federal taxes on real property. The Constitution of the United States\nspecifically prohibits such taxes. The federal government does, however, tax\nincome derived from real property and gains realized on the sale of real property.\nThe federal government can impose a tax lien against property for failure to pay\nany tax due the Internal Revenue Service.\nState government States may legally levy taxes on real property, but most delegate this power to\ncounties, cities, townships and local taxing districts. Some states place limits on\nhow local governments may levy such taxes. States may impose a tax lien against\nproperty for failure to pay any real property taxes which the state has levied or\ndelegated to local taxing bodies.\nCounty and local\ngovernment Counties, cities and municipalities, townships and special tax districts levy taxes\non real property to raise funds for providing local services. It is common for the\ncounty to collect all real property taxes and distribute it among the other taxing\nbodies.\nTax districts County and local governments establish tax districts to collect funds for\nproviding specific services. The boundaries of such districts typically do not\ncoincide with municipal boundaries. The major tax district in most areas is the\nschool district. Other important tax districts are those for fire protection,\ncommunity colleges, and parks.\nA property tax bill might include tax levies from such districts as the following\nChapter 19: Real Estate Taxation 297",

For instance, a special tax district might be\ncreated to fund extension of municipal water service to a newly incorporated\narea. Unlike a permanent tax district such as the school district, a special tax\ndistrict is temporary, ceasing to exist once the costs of the specific project have\nbeen paid for.\nAD VALOREM TAXATION\nTax base totalling\nHomestead exemption\nOther exemptions\nTax rate derivation\nTax billing and collection\nGeneral property taxes are levied on an ad valorem basis, meaning that they are\nbased on the assessed value of the property. Assessed value is determined\naccording to state law, usually by a county or township assessor or appraiser.\nThe actual tax, though based on assessed value, may be derived as a legislated\npercentage of the assessed value. Land and improvements may be assessed\nseparately. Ad valorem taxes are paid annually.\nTax base totalling The tax base of an area is the total of the appraised or assessed values of all\nreal property within the area's boundaries, excluding partially or totally exempt\nproperties:\ntax base = assessed values - exemptions\nTaxing entities generate the annual revenues they require by levying taxes on the\ntax base. The tax rate, or millage rate, determines how much of a tax levy the\ntax base will receive. The tax rate for each taxing entity is calculated by dividing\nthe amount of revenue required by the tax base. This rate is then applied to the\ntaxable value of each individual real property to determine its tax levy.\nValue assessment. County or township officers, called assessors or appraisers,\nvalue the real property within their jurisdiction for purposes of levying taxes.\nThis valuation process results in an assessed value. Assessment practices differ\nfrom state to state. In many states, assessed value does not reflect the market\nvalue that an appraisal for other purposes might aim to estimate. For instance, in\nsome areas, assessors use a sales comparison approach to assess the value of land\nand a cost approach to value improvements.\n298 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The role of the assessor in the taxing process is limited to making the valuation\nand notifying the owner of the assessed value; other tax officials determine the\ntax rate and the tax levy.\nEqualization. Some taxing bodies recognize that local assessments can lead to\nunfairly high or low values for properties in certain areas. Therefore the\njurisdiction may establish equalization factors to level out the unevenness of\nvaluations. For instance, if assessed values of properties in one county are\nconsistently ten percent below the average for other counties, an equalization\nboard may multiply each assessed value in that county by a factor of 110% to\nraise them to the average level for the state.\nAppeals. Property owners may object to the assessed value of their property, but\nnot to the tax rate. An owner usually has a certain period to protest after receiving\nnotice of the assessed value. According to local law, a property owner must\npresent evidence that the assessor made an error to a review board or appeal\nboard. Typical evidence would include market data on comparable properties that\nsold recently, or evidence that neighboring properties had less appreciation or\neven declined in assessed value in comparison with the protestor's property. An\nowner who is dissatisfied with the actions of the appeals or review board can take\nthe protest to court.\nHomestead\nexemption A homestead is a parcel of real property that is owned and occupied as a family\nhome. Some states exempt a portion of the value of the homestead from\njudgments to protect families against eviction by creditors. States and counties\nmay exempt a portion of the assessed value of the principal residence from\nproperty taxation.\nA property owner generally qualifies for a homestead exemption by meeting two\ncriteria:\n\uf034 is head of a family\n\uf034 resides on the property for a required length of time\nSome states also allow a single person to claim the homestead exemption.\nDepending on state law, home owners may have to apply every year for the\nexemption, or they may receive it automatically without filing.\nOther exemptions Properties. Most states exempt certain types of property from property taxes.\nCertain classes of property owner may also be exempted or have a reduced\nliability. Exempted are:\n\uf034 government-owned properties\nreal properties owned by federal, state, and local governments are\nimmune from real property taxation\nChapter 19: Real Estate Taxation 299",

Miscellaneous exemptions may be granted to classes of property\nowner, such as: senior citizens, widows, and disabled individuals.\nStates and municipalities may also offer property tax reductions or exemptions to\ncertain industries to encourage economic growth.\nTax rate derivation Tax district budgeting. The derivation of a tax rate, or millage rate, begins with\nthe taxing body determining its funding requirements to provide services for the\nyear. This requirement is formalized in the annual budget. Then the county or\ndistrict looks at its sources of revenue, such as sales taxes, business taxes, income\ntaxes, state and federal grants, fees, and so forth. The part of the budgeted\nexpenditures that cannot be funded from other income sources must come from\nreal property taxes. This budgetary shortfall becomes the ad valorem tax levy.\nThe tax levy is derived every year, since budget requirements and revenue tallies\nare performed on an annual cycle.\nTax rate. Each individual taxing body has its own tax rate. The tax rate is\ndetermined by dividing the taxing body's budgeted amount to be collected from\nreal estate taxes by the tax base:\ntax requirement\n--------------------- = tax rate (millage rate)\ntax base\nIf, for example, a taxing body needs $500,000 from property taxes, and the tax\nbase for the district is $15,000,000, the tax rate for this body is:\n500,000\n------------- = .03\n15,000,000\nThis tax rate of .03 or 3% may be expressed in a number of ways, depending on\nlocal practice: as mills, as dollars per $100 of assessed value, or as dollars per\n$1,000 of assessed value. A mill is one one-thousandth of a dollar ($.001). A tax\nrate of one mill means that the owner pays one dollar for every thousand dollars\nof assessed value. Thus the rate of .03 above could be expressed as:\n30 mills\n$3 per $100\n$30 per $1,000\n3 percent\nTax rate limitations. Some states, counties or other taxing districts place\nlimitations or caps on the absolute millage rate or the annual increase in millage\nfor property taxes. In such situations, taxing bodies are forced to limit their\nbudget requirements, unless there has been a sufficient increase in tax base to\nproduce the required funds without raising the millage rate.\n300 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Tax billing and\ncollection Individual owner billings. Each property owner's tax bill is determined by\nmultiplying the tax rate for each taxing district times the taxable value of the\nproperty. Taxable value is the assessed value after all exemptions and\nadjustments have been taken into account.\nFor example, a certain property is owned and occupied as a primary residence\nand qualifies for a homestead exemption. The assessed value of the property is\n$240,000, and the exemption is $75,000. The property is taxed by the school\ndistrict at a rate of 5 mills, and by the county at a rate of 2 mills. The property tax\nbill for these items would be calculated as follows.\nExhibit 19.1 Tax Bill Calculation\nI. Taxable Value\nassessed value $ 240,000\n- homestead exemption $ 75,000\ntaxable value $ 165,000\nII.

Totaling\nschool tax $ 825\n+ county tax $ 330\ntotal tax bill $ 1,155\nPayment deadlines are usually set by law and differ from region to region.\nDifferent taxing bodies may have different fiscal years, and as a result may issue\ntax bills at different times of the year. It is more common for a county to issue a\nbill that consolidates the bills of all the lesser taxing bodies. The consolidated bill\nmay be payable annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or on some other schedule as\nprescribed by law. In many cases where the owner has a mortgage and a required\nescrow account, the escrow officer will pay the tax bill. The owner will only\nreceive notice of the assessed value and the tax statement.\nSPECIAL ASSESSMENTS\nA special assessment is a tax levied against specific properties that will benefit from\na public improvement. Common examples are assessments for sidewalks, water\nservice and sewers. Special assessments are based on the cost of the\nChapter 19: Real Estate Taxation 301",

The project cost is $200,000. Although there are 100 properties in\nthe subdivision, only the 50 that are directly on the canal stand to benefit.\nTherefore, assuming each canal-front lot receives equal benefit, the 50 properties\nare each assessed $4,000 as a special assessment tax. Note that once the work is\ncompleted and paid, the assessment is discontinued.\nIf a taxing entity initiates an assessment, the assessment creates an involuntary\ntax lien. If property owners initiate the assessment by requesting the local\ngovernment to provide the improvement, the assessment creates a voluntary tax\nlien.\nSpecial assessments are usually paid in installments over a number of years.\nHowever, taxpayers generally have the option of paying the tax in one lump sum\nor otherwise accelerating payment.\nTAX LIEN ENFORCEMENT\nSale of tax certificates\nTax deed\nTax sale\nIf taxes remain unpaid for a period of time specified by state law, the tax\ncollecting agency may enforce the tax lien in several ways, depending on what\nthe law prescribes.\nSale of tax\ncertificates Some states sell tax certificates. The buyer of a tax certificate agrees to pay the\ntaxes due. After a period of time specified by law, the holder of the tax certificate\non a property may then apply for a tax deed.\nTax deed A tax deed is a legal instrument for conveying title when a property is sold for\nnon-payment of taxes. The application for a tax deed causes the taxing agency to\ninstitute a tax sale or tax foreclosure.\nTax sale A tax sale is frequently some type of auction. If the tax has not already been paid\nthrough the tax certificate process, the buyer of the property must pay the taxes\ndue. There is usually a legally-prescribed redemption period during which the\ndefaulted taxpayer has the right to buy back the property and reclaim title. If the\ntaxpayer can redeem the property by paying the delinquent taxes and any other\ncharges before the tax sale occurs, this right is known as an equitable right of\nredemption. If the taxpayer can redeem the property after the tax sale, this right is\nknown as a statutory right of redemption. In this case, the taxpayer must pay the\namount paid by the winning bidder at the tax sale, plus any charges, additional\ntaxes, or interest that may have accumulated. If the defaulted taxpayer does not\nredeem the property within the allotted time, the state issues the tax deed to\nconvey title.\n302 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The prohibition relates to\nselling, renting, inheriting, and conveying real estate.\nExecutive Order 11063. While the Civil Rights Act of 1866 prohibited\ndiscrimination, it was only marginally enforced. In 1962, the President issued\nExecutive Order 11063 to prevent discrimination in residential properties\nfinanced by FHA and VA loans. The order facilitated enforcement of fair housing\nwhere federal funding was involved.\nCivil Rights Act\nof 1968 Title VIII (Fair Housing Act). Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, known\ntoday as the Fair Housing Act, prohibits discrimination in housing based on race,\ncolor, religion, or national origin. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal\nOpportunity (FHEO) administers and enforces Title VIII under the supervision\nof the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\nForms of illegal\ndiscrimination The Fair Housing Act specifically prohibits such activities in residential brokerage\nand financing as the following.\nDiscriminatory misrepresentation. An agent may not conceal available\nproperties, represent that they are not for sale or rent, or change the sale terms for\nthe purpose of discriminating. For example, an agent may not inform a minority\nbuyer that the seller has recently decided not to carry back second mortgage\nfinancing when in fact the owner has made no such decision.\nDiscriminatory advertising. An agent may not advertise residential properties in\nsuch a way as to restrict their availability to any prospective buyer or tenant.\nProviding unequal services. An agent may not alter the nature or quality of\nbrokerage services to any party based on race, color, sex, national origin, or\nreligion. For example, if it is customary for an agent to show a customer the latest\nMLS publication, the agent may not refuse to show it to any party. Similarly, if it\nis customary to show qualified buyers prospective properties immediately, an\nagent may not alter that practice for purposes of discrimination.\nSteering. Steering is the practice of directly or indirectly channeling customers\ntoward or away from homes and neighborhoods. Broadly interpreted, steering\noccurs if an agent describes an area in a subjective way for the purpose of\nencouraging or discouraging a buyer about the suitability of the area.\nFor example, an agent tells Buyer A that a neighborhood is extremely attractive,\nand that desirable families are moving in every week. The next day, the agent\ntells Buyer B that the same neighborhood is deteriorating, and that values are\nstarting to fall. The agent has blatantly steered Buyer B away from the area and\nBuyer A into it.\nBlockbusting. Blockbusting is the practice of inducing owners in an area to sell\nor rent to avoid an impending change in the ethnic or social makeup of the\nneighborhood that will cause values to go down.\n306 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Many states require sellers to make a written\ndisclosure about property condition to a prospective buyer. This seller disclosure\nmay or may not relieve the agent of some liabilities for disclosure.

Some exceptions and exemptions apply. When required, the disclosure\nmust be transmitted to the prospective buyer no later than when the buyer makes\nan offer.\nA typical form requires the seller to affirm whether or not problems exist in any\nof the listed features and systems of the property. In denying that a problem\nexists, the seller claims to have no knowledge of a defect. If a defect does in fact\nexist, the seller can be held liable for intentional misrepresentation. A third\npossible response to a property condition question is that of \u201cno representation.\u201d\nHere, the seller makes no claim of knowledge as to whether a problem exists.\nWith this answer, the seller is no longer held liable for a disclosure of any kind\nrelating to a particular feature, whether a defect is known or otherwise.\nChapter 20: Professional Practices 311",

    "text": "Environmental\nissues Health hazards occur within structures, on real estate parcels, and in the area\nsurrounding real estate. They may occur naturally or as a result of human\nactivity. Environmental laws regulate some, but not all, health hazards that affect\nreal estate. Real estate agents, owners, and sellers have various responsibilities\nfor detecting, disclosing, and remediating regulated hazards. Some important\nissues are reviewed below. There is further information in the \u201cEnvironmental\nControls\u201d section of Chapter 8.\nLead-based paint. This hazard cannot be absorbed through the skin, but it\nbecomes dangerous when it is ingested or inhaled. It can be found in most homes\nbuilt before 1978 and can be present in the air, drinking water, food,\ncontaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust from the paint. Children are\nparticularly susceptible because young children are known to eat chips of the\npaint, allowing the lead to enter their bloodstreams. Homebuyers and renters are\nrequired to be given the EPA-HUD-US Consumer Product Safety Commission's\nbooklet, \"Protect Your Family from Lead in Your Home\" and must be informed\nif lead-based paint is present in the home. Buyers may have a risk assessment\nperformed prior to purchasing the home.\nMold. This is a fungus that grows under moist conditions and causes allergic\nreaction for some people. The presence of mold in the home must be disclosed as\na latent defect. Flooding and water damage must also be disclosed as both of\nthose can lead to mold growth. Inspections do not always find mold because it\noften grows inside walls and ductwork. Most molds require removal by a\nprofessional.\nAsbestos. While harmless in its original condition, it can cause lung cancer if its\ndust filters into the air. If it is found in a home during remodeling, it must be\nremoved by professionals to prevent contamination. It can be found in roofing\nand siding, older insulation, textured paint, artificial ashes sold for gas fireplaces,\nsome vinyl floor tiles, coatings for older hot water and steam pipes.\nAir quality. The quality of air in a home can be adversely impacted by the\npresence of carbon monoxide, radon, deteriorating asbestos and lead-based paint,\nmethamphetamine production, formaldehyde, and other toxic chemicals. Homes\ncan and should be tested for many of these contaminants prior to purchase.\nWater quality. Ground water is easily contaminated from septic tanks,\nagricultural runoff, highway de-icing, landfills, pesticides, animal waste, etc.\nMany people rely on ground water for drinking so must be aware that\ncontaminated water can cause problems from mild stomach problems to cancer\nand death. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets standards for\nprotecting ground water from contamination. It also offers advice and resources\nto facilitate the rehabilitation of contaminated ground water sources. One such\nmeans of protection is to advise private well users to have the water tested at least\nonce a year.\nCarbon monoxide. This is an odorless, colorless, toxic gas that can kill a person\nbefore its presence is known. It can be caused by unvented kerosene and gas\nspace heaters; leaking chimneys; back-drafting from furnaces, gas water heaters,\nwood stoves, and fireplaces; gas stoves, gasoline powered equipment, vehicle\n316 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "exhaust in garages, tobacco smoke. Carbon monoxide can be detected in a\nstructure by a unit similar to a smoke alarm which should be included in every\nhome, especially those with gas equipment and fireplaces or furnaces.\nFaulty septic systems. Inspections of septic systems are important because these\nsystems take wastewater from the property, remove most of the contaminants,\nand then put the water into the soil. If the system is faulty, it can be releasing\ncontaminated water into the soil, thereby contaminating the soil. Potential buyers\nand septic system users should have the county health department conduct an\ninspection of the system.\nIllegal drug manufacturing. Manufacturing illegal drugs such as\nmethamphetamine produces highly toxic fumes that last a long time. Continued\nexposure to the fumes can cause fatal burns to the lungs, can damage the liver\nand spleen, and can lead to learning disabilities. Any property suspected as\nhaving been a place for drug manufacturing should be investigated prior to being\nsold or leased, and the possible health hazards must be disclosed to the potential\nbuyer or renter.\nRadon. This is the easiest hazard to detect and mitigate. It is an odorless,\ncolorless, tasteless, and radioactive gas that is created in the ground where\nuranium and radium exist. Prolonged exposure to radon can cause lung cancer. It\ncan enter the home through any cracks, gaps, or cavities, including crawl spaces\nand openings around pipes. It can be easily detected by a radon test, so home\ninspections should include this test.\nUrea formaldehyde. This type of hazard is found in foam thermal insulation in\nhomes built before 1980. The formaldehyde gas emissions from the insulation\ndecrease over time, so most homes with the insulation no longer pose a threat.\nThe most common sources of formaldehyde in a home are pressed wood products\nsuch as particleboard, hardwood plywood paneling, and medium density\nfiberboard. Plastic furniture, new carpeting, and other vinyl materials also emit\nformaldehyde gases during the first few months after installation. Formaldehyde\ncan cause eye problems, nausea, breathing problems, and allergic reactions.\nLeaking underground storage tanks. USTs have at least 10 percent of their\nvolume underground and are used to store fuel oil, gasoline, and other toxic\nfluids. Tanks made of steel can corrode over time and leak their contents into the\nsurrounding soil, contaminating groundwater. They also provide a potential for\nfire and explosion. Tank removal is expensive, so removal is not common.\nTherefore, potential buyers must be informed of the presence of a UST on the\nproperty and of the health and financial risks of purchasing a property that\ncontains a UST.\nClean Air and Clean Water Acts. The Clean Air Act of 1963, since amended a\nnumber of times, was designed to control air pollution on a national level.\nAmong other things, the act authorizes the setting of standards for controlling the\nemission of pollutants and monitoring air quality. It identifies hazardous air\npollutants such as formaldehyde and regulates their use. Importantly, the act\nallows private citizens to sue other citizens to enforce the law.\nThe Clean Water Act, officially known as the Federal Water Pollution Control\nAct Amendments of 1972, together with revisions contained in the Clean Water\nChapter 20: Professional Practices 317",

The Clean Water Act does not directly deal with groundwater\ncontamination, which is addressed in the Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act, and the Superfund act.\nSafe Drinking Water Act. Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act\n(SDWA) in 1974 (amended 1986 and 1996) to regulate and protect the public\nsupply of drinking water. The act authorizes the setting of standards, protection\nof water sources, training of operators, funding of improvements, and\ndissemination of information. Under the act, water suppliers must report health\nrisks to the EPA within 24 hours of discovery. Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) oil\nand gas production poses one of the greatest current threats to groundwater.\nProperty sellers generally must disclose the source of drinking water for the\nproperty and the presence, type and location of any septic system on the property.\nA water supply other than a municipal one and any septic system other than a\nstandard one should be tested.\nBrownfields Law. Brownfields are abandoned commercial or industrial sites that\nare likely to contain toxic material. The Small Business Liability Relief and\nBrownfields Revitalization Act (known as the Brownfields Law), passed in 2002\nprovides clean-up funds, liability protections, and tax incentives to reclaim\ncontaminated properties. Under this law, owners who neither caused nor\ncontributed to the contamination are released from liability for the clean up.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. The EPA was established on December 2,\n1970 to bring together federal research, monitoring, standard-setting and\nenforcement activities into one agency dedicated to environmental protection.\nThe EPA, working with state, local, and tribal governments, enforces the Clean\nAir and Clean Water Acts along with other environmental laws.\nDisclosure obligations and liabilities. As discussed in an earlier chapter,\nlicensees are expected to be aware of environmental issues and to know where to\nlook for professional help. They are not expected to have expert knowledge of\nenvironmental law nor of physical conditions in a property. Rather, they must\ntreat potential environmental hazards in the same way that they treat other\nmaterial facts about a property: disclosure. It is advisable to have an attorney\ndraft the appropriate disclosures to lessen the broker's liability should problems\noccur in the future.\nThe Lead-based Paint Act of 1992 requires a seller or seller\u2019s agent to disclose\nknown lead problems in properties built before 1978. The licensee must give\nthe buyer or lessee a copy of the EPA-HUD-US Consumer Product Safety\nCommission booklet, \u201cProtect Your Family from Lead in your home.\u201d\nFurther, the 1996 lead-based paint regulation requires sellers or lessors of almost\nall residential properties built before 1978 to disclose known lead-based paint\nhazards and provide any relevant records available. The seller is not required to\ntest for lead but must allow the buyer a ten-day period for lead inspection.

The company usually has established relationships\nwith specific service providers and may use only those providers for service\nunder the warranty. The homeowner is typically charged a service fee on top of\nthe annual fee for each repair job.\nInspections Process. Property inspections may identify builder oversights or the need for\nmajor repairs. They may also identify the need for regular maintenance to keep\nthe property in good condition. In addition to looking for structural issues,\nplumbing and electrical problems, and roof and foundation issues, inspections\ncan uncover termites or other pests that are damaging the structure. Inspections\ncan also uncover environmental issues that have a detrimental impact on the\nproperty.\nTermite inspections. Termites are destructive pests that exist in all states except\nAlaska. They cause an estimated $50 billion in damage to buildings each year.\nThey often cause extensive damage to the property before the owner even\nrealizes there is a problem. Termites eat wood from the inside out, so they are not\neasily discovered except by professional inspectors. Having homes inspected\nannually for termites can prevent substantial damage and cost.\nThe most common type of termite is the subterranean termite.

Most states require disclosure of known material facts\nregarding residential properties of one to four units. If a licensee knows the result\nof an inspection, this is a material fact to be disclosed. Disclosure of\nenvironmental issues on commercial and industrial properties is often not\nmandated. Where disclosure is not required, real estate licensees should suggest\nthe use of a professional environmental audit.\nHomeowners\u2019\nassociations States have various requirements for a seller\u2019s property condition disclosure\nstatement to be completed by the seller and furnished to the buyer. Any such\ndisclosure is likely to include whether the property is subject to a common\ninterest property plan (e.g. condominium), whether the plan imposes any\nrestrictions, whether membership in a Homeowners\u2019 Association (HOA) is\nobligatory, and the identity of the HOA, if any.\nState law will typically require the association or management company to\nprovide association documents to the buyer to satisfy the seller disclosure\nrequirements. These documents may be attached to or delivered in conjunction\nwith the sale contract. The contract itself usually specifies the timing of the\ndisclosures. There may be a place on the contract for the buyer to acknowledge\nreceipt and knowledge of the HOA disclosures. In some states, the seller\u2019s agent\ngathers and provides the documents to a buyer or buyer\u2019s agent before the writing\nof an offer.\nA typical HOA disclosure package includes\n\uf034 declarations\n\uf034 articles of incorporation\n\uf034 bylaws\n\uf034 articles of organization\n\uf034 operating agreements\n\uf034 rules and regulations\n\uf034 party wall agreements\n\uf034 minutes of annual owners\u2019 meeting\n322 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

This professional\ncode has emerged from three primary sources:\n\uf034 federal and state legislation\n\uf034 state real estate licensing regulation\n\uf034 industry self-regulation through trade associations and institutes\nFederal legislation focuses primarily on anti-discrimination laws and fair trade\npractices. State laws and licensing regulations focus on agency and disclosure\nrequirements and regulating certain brokerage practices within the state\njurisdiction. Real estate trade groups focus on professional standards of conduct\nin every facet of the business.\nBy observing professional ethics and standards, licensees will serve clients and\ncustomers better, foster a professional image in the community, and avoid\nregulatory sanctions and lawsuits.\nToday's professional ethics are not only important for one's career; they are also\nlegal imperatives.\nTrade associations representing the real estate industry have instituted their own\ncodes of ethics and professional practices covering every facet of brokerage\nactivity.

The wholesaler finds a willing seller, puts\nthe property under contract, and finds a third-party buyer willing to buy at a\nhigher price than what the wholesaler has agreed to pay the original seller. At\nclosing, the wholesaler assigns the contract to the ultimate buyer; the ultimate\nbuyer settles with the original seller and pays the wholesaler the difference in the\ntwo contracts as a fee.\nSome states require the wholesaler in such transactions to hold a real estate\nlicense.\nLove letters Buyers sometimes try to enhance the attractiveness of a purchase offer by\nattaching a personal note to the offer. This appeal to the seller, called a \u201clove\nletter,\u201d typically mentions such things as why the buyer particularly likes the\nhome, how the buyer imagines family life in the home, and how well the buyer\nwill care for the home.\nThe practice is discouraged in some states and by some real estate associations as\ncreating the possibility of liability for fair housing violations. Since the letter may\ndivulge information about such characteristics of the buyer as race, religion, or\nfamilial status, it could be construed as providing an unlawful basis for the\nseller\u2019s decision to accept or reject an offer.\nSome sellers explicitly refuse to accept these love letters. Best practice is to\navoid the use of love letters and find other ways to make the offer attractive.\nProfessional\nrelationships Professional conduct excludes disparagement of competitors. Real estate\nprofessionals also\n\uf034 forgo pursuit of unfair advantage\n\uf034 arbitrate rather than litigate disputes\n\uf034 respect the agency relationships of others\n\uf034 conform to accepted standards of co-brokerage practices\nChapter 20: Professional Practices 325",

During this\nevent, the buyer pays the purchase price and receives title to the purchased real\nestate. At the same time, the buyer completes financing arrangements, and buyer\nand seller pay all required taxes, fees, and charges.\nCustomary Practices. Procedures and customary practices for conducting real\nestate closings vary from state to state. For example, it is common in some states\nfor sellers to pay title insurance, while in other states the buyer and seller might\nshare this expense. Students should refer to supplemental state materials to\nascertain prevailing practices in their state.\nTime. The sale contract sets the date of the closing, usually within sixty days of\nsigning. The time period between signing and closing is expected to be sufficient\nfor the removal of any contingencies, such as the buyer's obtaining of financing,\nthe performance of inspections, and the correction of identified physical defects.\nFailure of either buyer or seller to perform pre-closing actions specified in the\ncontract can delay or terminate the transaction. If the contract includes a\nstatement that \"time is of the essence,\" all parties agree to meet the time\nlimitations exactly as stated. If both parties consent, however, they can re-\nschedule the closing date.\nLocation. Closings occur at various locations, such as the office of the title\ncompany, the lender, the escrow agent, one of the attorneys, the broker, or the\ncounty recorder. The sale contract specifies the location.\nChapter 21:Closings 329",

    "text": "Parties at closing. The primary parties at the closing are normally buyer, seller,\nand a closing agent or escrow officer. Other parties who might be present\ninclude the title officer, attorneys, brokers or agents, and the lender's\nrepresentative. It is not actually necessary for any of these parties to attend the\nmeeting. The closing agent can complete the transaction, provided all documents\nhave been duly executed in advance.\nThe closing process The closing process consists of buyer and seller verifying that each has fulfilled\nthe terms of the sale contract. If they have, then the mortgage loan, if any, is\nclosed, all expenses are apportioned and paid, the consideration is exchanged for\nthe title, final documents are signed, and arrangements are made to record the\ntransaction according to local laws.\nExhibit 21.1 The Closing Process\nConfirm performance\nClose loan\nPay expenses\nExchange funds & title\nComplete documents\nRecord transaction\nTransfer of title The seller must produce evidence of marketable title, such as a commitment for\ntitle insurance by a title insurer. Before making a title commitment, a title\ncompany performs a title search to discover any liens, encumbrances, restrictions,\nconditions, or easements attaching to the title.\nIf there are any encumbrances or liens that damage the title, the seller is expected\nto remove these prior to the date specified in the contract. The most common title\ncloud is an unpaid lien.\nThe seller may also be asked to execute an affidavit of title stating that, since the\ndate of the original title search, the seller has incurred no new liens, judgments,\nunpaid bills for repairs or improvements, no unrecorded deeds or contracts, no\nbankruptcies or divorces that would affect title, or any other defects the seller is\naware of.\n330 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The purchaser, purchaser's lender, or title company may require a survey to verify\nthe location and size of the property. The survey also identifies any easements,\nencroachments, or flood plain hazard.\nThe buyer should inspect the property to make certain that the property is in the\ncondition in which the seller states that it is, and that any repairs or other required\nactions have been performed. A final inspection, called a buyer's walk-through,\nshould be conducted as close to the closing date as possible.\nIf the seller's mortgage lien(s) are to be satisfied at closing, the lender will\nprovide a payoff statement, also called an offset statement, specifying the\namount of unpaid principal and any interest due as of the closing date, plus fees\nthat will be due the lender and any credits or penalties that may apply. The holder\nof a note secured by a trust deed will provide a similar statement, called a\nbeneficiary statement, to show any unpaid balance. Even if the buyer is\nassuming the seller's mortgage loan, the buyer will want to know the exact\namount of the unpaid balance as of the closing date.\nFinally, the seller produces and/or deposits with the escrow agent the deed that\nconveys the property to the buyer.\nTransfer of purchase\nfunds The buyer usually produces and/or deposits with the escrow agent the following:\n\uf034 earnest money\n\uf034 loan funds and documents\n\uf034 any other cash needed to complete the purchase\nEscrow procedures If the closing occurs \"in escrow\" rather than face-to-face, the principal parties\ndeposit funds and documents with the appointed escrow agent, and the escrow\nagent disburses funds and releases documents to the appropriate parties when all\nthe conditions of the escrow have been met. If for any reason the transaction\ncannot be completed, for instance if the buyer refuses the title as it is offered, or\nthe buyer fails to produce the necessary cash, the escrow instructions usually\nprovide a mechanism for reconveying title to the seller and funds to the buyer. In\nsuch a case, both parties return to their original status as if no sale had occurred.\nLender closing\nrequirements A lender is concerned about the quality of the collateral a borrower is providing\nin return for the mortgage loan. The collateral would be endangered by defects in\nthe title, by liens that would take precedence over the mortgage lien, such as a tax\nlien, and by physical damage to the property which is not repaired. Consequently,\nthe lender typically requires a survey; a property inspection; hazard insurance; a\ntitle insurance policy; a reserve account for taxes and insurance; and possibly,\nprivate mortgage insurance. In some cases the lender may also require a\ncertificate of occupancy verifying that any new construction performed complies\nwith local building codes.\nBroker's role A broker usually continues to provide service between the signing of the sale\ncontract and the closing by helping to make arrangements for pre-closing\nactivities such as inspections, surveys, appraisals and repairs and generally taking\nsteps to ensure that the closing can proceed as scheduled.\nChapter 21:Closings 331",

RESPA specifies certain\nclosing procedures when a purchase:\n\uf034 involves a residential property, including one- to four-family\nresidences, cooperatives and condominiums;\n\uf034 involves a first or second mortgage lien; and\n\uf034 is being financed by a \"federally-related\" mortgage loan, which\nincludes loans made by a federally-insured lender; loans insured\nor guaranteed by the VA or FHA, loans administered by HUD,\nand loans intended to be sold to FNMA, FHLMC, or GNMA.\nRESPA regulations do not apply to transactions being otherwise financed except\nin the case of an assumption in which the terms of the assumed loan are modified\nor the lender's charges for the assumption are greater than $50.\nRESPA is directed at lenders and settlement companies, but licensees should be\nfamiliar with requirements and changes implemented as of January, 2014. The\nDodd-Frank Act of 2010 granted rule-making authority under RESPA to the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and generally granted the CFPB\nauthority to supervise and enforce compliance with RESPA and its implementing\n332 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The amendments also included new provisions related to escrow\npayments, force-placed insurance, general servicing policies, procedures, and\nrequirements, early intervention, continuity of contact, loss mitigation and the\nrelation of RESPA\u2019s servicing provisions to State law. These RESPA\namendments went into effect on January 10, 2014.\nTRID Effective October 3, 2015, a TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule (TRID)\nintegrates the disclosure requirements of RESPA and Truth-in-Lending, replacing\nthe old Good Faith Estimate form and HUD-1 Uniform Settlement Statement a\nnew Loan Estimate form and Closing Disclosure form, respectively.\nInformation booklet A lender subject to RESPA must give loan applicants the CFPB booklet, \"Your\nHome Loan Toolkit,\" within three days of receiving a loan application. This\nbooklet describes loans, closing costs, and the Closing Disclosure form.\nLoan Estimate A lender must give the applicant, at the time of application or within three\nbusiness days of application, a Loan Estimate (H-24) of likely settlement costs.\nThis estimate is usually based on comparable transactions completed in the area.\nThe terms stated in the Closing Disclosure must agree with those of the Loan\nEstimate within certain limits.\nMortgage servicing\ndisclosure The lender must disclose to the buyer whether the lender intends to service the loan\nor convey it to another lender for servicing. This disclosure must also be\naccompanied by information as to how the buyer can resolve complaints.\nClosing\nDisclosure Under CFPB rules, a lender must use the Closing Disclosure (H-25) to disclose\nsettlement costs to the buyer. This form covers all costs that the buyer will have\nto pay at closing, whether to the lender or to other parties. Use of this form\nenforces RESPA's prohibitions against a lender's requiring a buyer to deposit an\nexcessive amount in the tax and insurance escrow account or to use a particular\ntitle company for title insurance. The consumer must receive the completed form\nnot later than three business days before closing and has the right to inspect a\nrevised form one business day before closing.

The statement\nmust also disclose shortfalls or overages in the account, and how the\ndiscrepancies will be resolved.\nLimits on escrow\naccounts Section 10 of RESPA limits the amounts lenders can require borrowers to place\nin escrow for purposes of paying taxes, hazard insurance, and other property-\nrelated expenses. The limitation applies to the initial deposits as well as deposits\nmade over the course of the loan\u2019s term.\nReferral fees\nand kickbacks RESPA prohibits the payment of fees as part of a real estate settlement when no\nservices are actually rendered.

Disburse funds.\nSelling terms and\nclosing costs Selling terms are the price of the property, the buyer's deposit and\ndownpayment, and the terms and amounts of the buyer's financing\narrangements. Closing costs are final expenses that buyer or seller must pay at\nclosing to complete the transaction. The sale contract identifies all selling terms\nand who pays which costs. The apportionment of expenses is subject to\nnegotiation, and in the absence of a specific agreement, is determined by\ncustom. Closing costs include such items as brokerage fees, mortgage-related\nfees, title-related expenses, and real estate taxes.\nDebits and credits The closing statement accounts for the debits and credits of the buyer and seller\nto settle and complete the transaction. A debit is an amount that one party must\npay at closing or has already paid prior to closing.

The\n360/30-day method is commonly used for prorating mortgage interest. Either\nmethod may be used for real estate taxes, depending on local practice.\nIt is customary in most states that the seller owns the property up to and including\nthe day of closing unless stated otherwise in the contract. Thus the closing day is\napportioned to the seller in computing prorations. The method of prorating, if not\nspecified in the contract, will follow local custom.\n12-month / 30 day\nmethod The 12-month/30-day method determines an average daily rate of payment for an\nitem to be prorated based on a 30-day month and a 360-day year. The method\nconsists of the following steps for annual and monthly items.\nAnnual items\n1. Identify the total amount to be prorated.\n2. Divide this amount by 12 to obtain an average monthly rate.\n3. Divide the monthly rate by 30 to obtain an average daily rate.\n4. Multiply the monthly amount times the seller's number of\nmonths of ownership in the year of the sale up to the month of\nclosing. For the month of closing, multiply the seller's number of\ndays of ownership times the daily amount and add the result to\nthe previous result. The final result is the seller's pro rata share of\nthis item.\n5. The buyer's pro rata share of an item is the total amount less the\nseller's pro rata share.\nMonthly items\n1. Identify the total amount to be prorated.\n2. Divide this amount by 30 to obtain the average daily amount.\n3. Multiply the daily amount times the seller's number of days of\nownership.

    "text": "22\nRisk Management\nRisk Management Strategies\nRisk Management Procedures\nPrimary Areas of Risk\nRisk is the chance of losing something. Its two dimensions are the probability of\noccurrence and the extent of exposure to monetary or non-monetary\nconsequences. Since most risks are related to judgments and decisions, the real\nestate licensee, who makes numerous complex decisions every day, faces a high\ndegree of risk potential.\nRisk management is a structured approach to dealing with the uncertainties and\nconsequences of risk. In real estate practice, the aim is to reduce risk to an\nacceptable level through anticipation and planning.\nRISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES\nAvoidance\nReduction\nTransference\nRetention\nFour well-established strategies for managing risk are:\n\uf034 Avoidance (elimination)\n\uf034 Reduction (mitigation, sharing)\n\uf034 Transference (outsourcing, insuring)\n\uf034 Retention (acceptance and budgeting)\nNot all of these strategies are always possible or available, but a real estate firm\nor licensee who fails to make a conscious effort to employ one or more of them\nincreases the likelihood of loss from the many potential risks that are always\npresent in the real estate business.\nAvoidance Avoidance includes refraining from an activity that carries risk. One can avoid\nthe risks of being in an automobile accident by not riding in automobiles.\nAvoiding risks also means missing the opportunity to benefit from the avoided\nactivity. By avoiding automobile travel, one is confined to modes of\ntransportation, such as buses and walking, that do not offer the same high degree\nof personal freedom and efficiency. Complete avoidance of risk in real estate\npractice is almost impossible. A broker, for instance, may believe that hiring only\nexperienced affiliates eliminates the risk that affiliates will commit license law\nviolations. However, even experienced practitioners may not know the law, and,\nsometimes, people break the law deliberately. The risk may be reduced, but it\nremains.\n358 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Reduction Reduction involves taking steps to reduce the probability or the severity of a\npotential loss. However, this strategy may result in reducing risk in one area only\nto increase it in another. A familiar example is a sprinkler system that dispenses\nwater to reduce the risk of fire but at the same time increases the risk of water\ndamage.\nIn real estate practice, one risk reduction tactic is to share responsibility for\nmaking a decision. The agent provides the consumer with expertise, and perhaps\nsome advice, but lets the consumer decide how much to offer. In this way, the\nagent gets some relief from the risks inherent in the buyer\u2019s decision to purchase.\nTransference Transference means passing the risk to another party, by contract or other means.\nAn insurance policy is the common example, but sometimes the wording of a\nsales or personal services contract can transfer risk without resorting to insurance.\nIn the real estate business, transference is typically and most successfully\naccomplished by means of an errors and omissions (E&O) insurance policy,\neither on the individuals in a firm or on the firm itself. State law may require such\ninsurance.\nRetention Retention of risk means entering into an activity in spite of known risks and\ntaking full responsibility for the consequences. This is, in effect, self-insurance,\nthe only strategy left when risk cannot be reduced or transferred and one has\ndecided not to avoid it because of the desirability of the potential benefits.\nExhibit 22.1 Risk Management Strategies and Procedures\nChapter 22: Risk Management 359",

When agents are familiar with\nthe forms provided by the office, how and when to complete them and where to\nsend them, the likelihood of errors is reduced. Likewise, agents need to be able to\nidentify and understand common contract elements, complete contract forms\ndeveloped by attorneys, and evaluate offers received from co-op agents on their\nlistings without committing a license violation or breach of law.\nIn most states, brokers have a legal obligation to provide training to affiliated\nlicensees. Licensees also have the obligation to seek out appropriate education and\ntraining outside the brokerage to ensure that they know how to comply with the\nlaw. In addition, licensees must satisfy legal requirements for continuing\neducation, while those who care about personal excellence will seek further\neducation and training to enhance their professional skills.\nDisclosure By ensuring that all parties have the information they are entitled to, proper\ndisclosure reduces the risk that clients and customers will accuse a licensee of\nmisleading or inducing them to make a decision with incomplete information.\nFurther, laws in every state require disclosures of one kind or another.\nDisclosure may be made in writing or verbally and may or may not require\nwritten acknowledgment from the receiving party.\nRequired disclosures usually include:\n\uf034 agency relationships\n\uf034 property condition\n\uf034 duties and obligations\n\uf034 personal interest in the transaction\n\uf034 personal interest in referrals\nDocumentation and\nRecord keeping Documentation provides evidence of compliance with laws and regulations.

A written and uniformly enforced company policy lets everyone\nin the firm know what to expect before problems arise. The policy manual should\ncover the company\u2019s rules in such areas as floor duty privileges, assignment of\nrelocation properties to agents, referrals between agents within the company, and\nrequirements for continuing education, sales meeting participation, and property\ntours.\nProcedures manual. A company procedures manual should spell out how to\nhandle every aspect of the company\u2019s business that agents and brokers need to\nknow\u2014from handling consumers\u2019 funds and documents, conducting consumer\ntransactions, dealing with MLS-related matters, and placing signage, to all\nprocedures prescribed by state or federal law, especially license, banking and fair\nhousing laws. Adherence to a procedures manual reduces the risk that an\nindividual will inadvertently commit an unlawful act. Whenever changes are\nmade to the policy or procedures manual, each agent should sign the revised\nmanual as evidence that the agent has examined it.\nStandard forms. Standard forms save time and protect against the unauthorized\npractice of law. Since they are most often prepared by lawyers familiar with the\nmarket area, they can address contingencies that are common in the area in a\nmanner that reflects the real estate laws of the state. On the other hand, a licensee\noften needs to adapt a standardized form for a client by assisting with filling in\nblanks, modifying terms, and attaching addenda. The licensee must always\nremain aware of the limitations the state has placed on such activities.\nHere are a few of the standard forms a brokerage should provide for its agents\nand affiliates:\n\uf034 buyer and seller representation agreements\n\uf034 agreement to show property\n\uf034 purchase and sale agreement\n\uf034 agency disclosure form\n\uf034 property condition disclosure, disclaimer, and exemption form\n\uf034 lease agreement\n\uf034 personal interest disclosure form\n\uf034 referral for service disclosure form\n\uf034 lead-based paint disclosure form\n\uf034 special disclosure forms (mold, radon, subsurface sewage system,\nimpact fees/adequate facilities taxes, etc.)\n\uf034 referral agreement\n\uf034 independent contractor agreement\n\uf034 closing checklist\nChapter 22: Risk Management 361",

Electronic communications should be archived on suitable electronic\nmedia.

Some\nof these types are also used to manage certain risks of brokers and licensees.\nGeneral Liability.

The insurer pays the covered claim and legal fees,\ncosts, and expenses, including medical expenses, resulting from owner\nnegligence or other causes. This type of insurance does not cover professional\nliability, for which an Errors & Omissions policy is necessary.\nErrors and Omissions. Professional liability is of two general types:\n1.

Breach of contract \u2013 a claim that one has failed to perform\nservices under the terms of a contract in a timely manner\nThe primary method for transferring the professional liability risks of brokers,\nmanagers, and licensees is Errors & Omissions (E&O) insurance.

    "text": "Agency The risks of agency will occur in one of two areas:\n\uf034 the requirement to inform and disclose\n\uf034 the requirement to carry out an agency duty.\nMost states require agency relationships to be in writing and to be disclosed to all\nparties to a transaction. State law may spell out agency duties, or the duties may\nbe a part of general agency law. In states that do not use agency, there is still the\nobligation to explain and disclose the nature of the relationship.\nDisclosure requirements. A licensee may be acting in a transaction as\nfacilitator, agent, subagent, designated agent, single agent, dual agent, non-agent\nor in some capacity. Regardless of status, the licensee must follow state\ndisclosure requirements. These are, typically, to:\n\uf034 disclose status verbally to other licensees on initial contact\n\uf034 disclose status verbally to buyer and seller before providing real\nestate services\n\uf034 confirm the disclosure in writing before signing a listing agreement\nor presenting a purchase offer (to an unrepresented seller) or before\npreparing a purchase offer (to an unrepresented buyer)\n\uf034 get a signed receipt indicating the written disclosure has been made\nCarrying out the duties of agency also require disclosures of :\n\uf034 personal interest the agent has in a transaction (such as owner or\nbuyer)\n\uf034 personal benefit the agent will derive from a service referral\n\uf034 required property and market information\n\uf034 information about customers a client is entitled to have\nDuties.

    "text": "The duty to exercise skill, care and diligence means that licensees may not be\ncasual or negligent in their actions. Licensee negligence is actionable when\nprincipals are harmed by the licensee\u2019s failure.\nThe duty of loyalty requires the agent to put the client\u2019s interests above those of\neveryone else, including his or her own.\nThe duty of obedience requires the agent to act on the principal\u2019s wishes\nregarding the transaction as long as they do not result in any illegal action. The\nduty of obedience never overrides the legal obligation of agents to deal fairly and\nhonestly with all parties.\nThe duty of confidentiality requires the agent to hold in confidence any\ninformation that would harm the client\u2019s interests or bargaining position or\nanything else the client wishes to keep secret, unless the law requires disclosure.\nThe duty of confidentiality survives the termination of the listing contract.\nThe duty of accounting applies to all funds involved in a real estate transaction.\nAccounts must be maintained as required by law, and escrow funds are to be\nhandled strictly in accordance with the law.\nThe duty of disclosure applies to both parties to a transaction, although usually\nwith some differences. Proper disclosure to customers primarily concerns agency,\nproperty condition, and environmental hazards. To the client, it generally\nconcerns all known facts regarding the property and the transaction, including\ninformation about the other transaction party. State laws prescribe what may,\nmust, and must not be disclosed. Licensees must be vigilant to avoid oversights\nand conflicts of interest that can lead to a disclosure to the wrong party or\ndisclosure of information that is confidential.\nConflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest arise when an agent forgets to put the\nbest interests of a client ahead of those of everyone else. This can happen in\nsituations involving undisclosed dual agencies, broker-owned listings, licensees\nbuying for their own account, vendor referrals, and property management\nsubcontracting of services, among many others. Even ordinary, everyday\ntransactions carry a built-in risk of conflict of interest. Consider the fact that a\nlicensee usually receives no compensation for a failed transaction.

Licensees must always disclose any self-interest they have in a\ntransaction, and always remember their duties to clients and consumers.\nConfidentiality. Licensees have a responsibility to maintain the confidentiality\nof certain kinds of information they obtain concerning clients and customers.\nThe duty to maintain confidentiality generally survives the termination of a\nlisting agreement into perpetuity.

Security procedures should protect\npersonal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or\ndisclosure. Confidential information, when it is not to be retained, must be\ndisposed of in a secure manner.\nPenalties.

The disclosure\nis usually required before any purchase contract is accepted.. A second disclosure\nmay be required at closing.

In most states, a listing\nagreement is enforceable only if it is in writing. Most states forbid net listings,\nbecause they violate the requirement that a valid listing agreement must specify a\nselling price and the agent\u2019s compensation. The licensee, in accordance with the\nduty of due diligence, must verify the accuracy of the statements in the listing\nregarding the property, the owner, and the owner's representations. Especially\nimportant facts for a broker or agent to verify are:\n\uf034 the property condition\n\uf034 ownership status\n\uf034 the client's authority to act\nAn agent who does not to act with a reasonable degree of due diligence in these\nmatters may be exposed to liability if it turns out that the property is not as\nrepresented or the client cannot perform the contract as promised.\nComparative Market Analysis (CMA). In preparing a Comparative Market\nAnalysis, licensees should guard against using the terms \u201cappraisal\u201d and \u201cvalue,\u201d\nwhich are reserved for the use of certified appraisers. Misuse of these terms could\nlead to a charge of misrepresenting oneself as an appraiser. In discussing listed\nproperties with clients or customers, real estate licensees should be careful to use\nguarded terms such as \u201crecommended listing price,\u201d \u201crecommended purchase\nprice,\u2019 and \u201crecommended listing price range.\u201d\nAgents should make every effort to help the sellers find a reasonable listing price\nbased on the current market. If the CMA leads the seller to list at a price that is\ntoo high, the seller may blame the agent when the transaction fails because of an\nappraisal that comes in below the selling price. To minimize this risk, it is best to\nbe conservative in the CMA and retain documentation that the seller went above\nthe recommended price in spite of the agent\u2019s advice.\nEstimate of Closing Costs. In preparing an estimate of closing costs for a seller\nor buyer, there is the risk of forgetting something, leading to an unpleasant\nsurprise when the consumer suddenly faces unexpected costs or conditions.\nLicensees should use their broker\u2019s form, if there is one, and make it clear to the\nconsumer that it is only an estimate of likely costs, not a statement of actual\ncosts. In some states, brokers and agents do not prepare closing cost estimates,\nleaving that task to the lender.\nAdvertising. State and federal laws regulate advertising, including the federal\nFair Housing laws as they pertain to discriminatory advertising and providing of\nservices. Advertising includes electronic communication, social\nmedia/networking, and internet marketing. Usage must be consistent with\ncompany image and legal requirements.

For instance,\npermission should be obtained before doing any of the following unless the\nlisting agreement specifically grants the authority:\n\uf034 post a sign on the property\n\uf034 remove other signs\n\uf034 show the property\n\uf034 hand out the property condition disclosure\n\uf034 distribute marketing materials\n\uf034 advertise in various media\n\uf034 use a multiple listing service\n\uf034 cooperate with other licensees\n\uf034 divide the commission or negotiate a commission split\n\uf034 share final sales data with the MLS\n\uf034 place a lock box on the property\n\uf034 appoint subagents\n\uf034 appoint a designated agent\n\uf034 change agency status\nScope of expertise.

However, in today\u2019s competitive environment,\nconsumers often demand much more from a licensee than the traditional basic\nservices. An agent who fails to live up to prevailing standards may be held liable\nfor negligence, fraud, or violation of state real estate license laws and regulations.\nAt the same time, agents must be particularly careful about the temptation to\nmisrepresent themselves as experts and offer inappropriate expert advice.\nDisclaimer and referral are always the best risk control procedures to forestall an\naccusation of misrepresentation from a consumer who claims to have been\nharmed by reliance on the licensee\u2019s non-existent expertise.

The unintentional practice of law without a\nlicense is a great risk in the contracting process, as well as in the representation\nprocess. It is illegal for real estate professionals who are not attorneys to draw up\ncontracts for transactions they are not involved in or to charge a separate fee for\npreparing a contract.\nSuch licensees may fill in blanks or make deletions on a preprinted contract form\nprepared by a lawyer. While a licensee may make deletions, additions to a form\nshould be drafted by an attorney. The principals themselves can make changes as\nlong as each change is signed or initialed by all signers. Preprinted riders can\noften be attached as addenda to a contract without an attorney.\nIt is also illegal for real estate licensees who are not lawyers to give legal advice\nor interpret contract language.

It is\nespecially necessary for paperwork and documentation to be accurate and concise\nin a situation where a fair housing issue could arise.\nAdvertising. The Fair Housing Act forbids real estate advertising that mentions\nrace, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status in any way\nthat suggests preference or discrimination. State laws may add other protected\ncategories, such as creed and age.\nRisk can be reduced by the use of street names or other non-biased geographical\nreferences when stating where the property is located, and by describing the\nproperty rather than the type of persons who might live in or around it.

When faced with questions that might lead to a steering\ncharge or other violation of fair housing laws, it is best for the licensee to limit the\nresponse to features of the home and to the process of selling, buying, and listing\nproperties, and refer the questioner to someone else to answer questions about\nsuch matters as the demographic make-up of the neighborhood. It is illegal for the\nlicensee to voice an opinion based on race, religion, color, creed, national origin,\nsex, handicap, elderliness, or familial status. The agent should explain this fact to\nthe buyer and be wary of any situation where the agent\u2019s behavior might be\nconstrued as discriminatory.\nListing agreements. Before entering into a listing agreement, a licensee should\nexplain that it is necessary to comply with fair housing laws and obtain the\npotential client\u2019s acknowledgment and agreement.

A seller cannot refuse to sell a property to an individual based on the\nindividual\u2019s belonging to a protected class, and if this is attempted, the real estate\nprofessional must not be involved. If the seller asks about the color, religion,\ncreed, national origin, ethnicity, age, or familial status of a buyer, the agent must\nexplain that it is illegal to give out such information. The best risk reduction\nprocedure is to treat all buyers and sellers equally, showing no preference for one\nover another.\nAntitrust Antitrust laws forbid brokers to band together to set a price on their services in\nlisting and selling property. Even being overheard discussing commission rates or\nbeing present at such a conversation can lead to charges of price fixing.\nThe law recognizes that some cooperative arrangements between firms \u2013 such as\njoint development projects \u2013 may help consumers by allowing these firms to\ncompete more effectively against each other. Even so the government does not\nprosecute all agreements between companies, but only those that will raise prices\nfor the public or deny the public new and better products.\nSherman Antitrust Act.

    "text": "consequences for the licensee. Third, if a licensee has a business relationship with\na recommended vendor or provider and neglects to disclose the fact, there are\nlicense violation consequences.\nThe major risk management technique is to shift the responsibility for choosing a\nvendor to the consumer. This can be done by refusing to recommend vendors at\nall; by presenting a broad range of choices and allowing the consumer to select;\nor by presenting a short list of thoroughly vetted vendors and allowing the\nconsumer to make the decision, always with the disclaimer that to the best of the\nlicensee\u2019s knowledge, the vendors on the list are competent and honest, but that\nthe consumer is responsible for investigating and making his or her own\njudgment before hiring or buying.\nFinancing and\nclosing In the financing and closing phases of a transaction, a consumer may feel that a\nlicensee has been incompetent or misleading. Licensees have an obligation to\ninform and educate their clients throughout the transaction process. Surprises and\naccusations of incompetence or misrepresentation are among possible results of\nfailing to keep the party informed.\nDiscrimination. Of course, it is important to comply with relevant laws.\nLicensees must be mindful of the requirements of ECOA and refrain from\nparticipating in any manner of discriminatory lending. It is illegal to:\n\uf034 threaten, coerce, intimidate or interfere with a person who is\nexercising a fair housing right or assisting another other to exercise\nthat right.\n\uf034 indicate a limitation or preference based on race, color, national\norigin, religion, sex, familial status, or handicap in any\nadvertisement or communication. Single-family and owner-\noccupied housing that is otherwise exempt from the Fair Housing\nAct is subject to this prohibition against discriminatory\nadvertising.\nProgress reporting. All inspections and tests must comply with local and state\nlaws and with the purchase contract. Progress reports should be accurate, timely,\nin writing, and free of speculation. If a consumer has a question about the\nmeaning of something in an inspection report, the licensee should refer the\nconsumer to the person who wrote the report rather than trying to explain it. This\nmethod transfers some of the risk inherent in interpreting the report.\nQualifying buyers. Many transactions fail because a buyer has been improperly\nqualified before the offer is presented. Using a lender to qualify the buyer saves\ntime and protects the agent against leading a seller to believe a purchaser is fully\nqualified when this may not be the case. Also, lenders and loan agents are better\nable to look into the buyer\u2019s qualifications than a real estate licensee is. If it\nbecomes necessary to show a property to a potential buyer who has not been\nqualified by a lender, the licensee can gain some protection by performing an\ninformal qualification and documenting the fact that it was based on the\ninformation provided by the buyer. The buyer\u2019s signature on this documentation\nChapter 22: Risk Management 375",

The licensee should explain loan fees, charges,\namounts, timing, and responsibilities. Agents can assist in the loan decision by\nexplaining how to compare loans with differing charges and interest rates. The\nfact that a high origination fee and points may make a loan with a low interest\nrate unattractive to a borrower is important information for the agent to provide,\nand providing it may protect the agent against a later complaint that the buyer\nsuffered a loss because of the agent\u2019s failure to inform.\nAppraisal problems. Delays and appraised value are the typical problem areas.\nFailure to inform parties about delays can compromise the transaction. An under-\nappraisal will require the buyer to make a larger down payment or the seller to\nlower the price. If the property appraises for more than the purchase price, the\nseller may blame the agent for suggesting the lower price. In such a case, the\nseller\u2019s agent\u2019s defense is that the seller agreed to the listing price and that the\nprice was a factor in attracting the buyer to the property.\nRESPA Violations. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)\nstipulates that the parties to certain purchase transactions must be given accurate\ninformation reflecting their closing costs. It also prohibits certain business\npractices that are not considered to be in the consumer\u2019s best interest.\nThe licensee\u2019s risks regarding RESPA primarily relate to\n\uf034 failing to ensure that the consumer is informed about his or\nher rights under the law\n\uf034 giving or receiving an illegal kickback.\nRESPA currently requires lenders to:\n\uf034 give a copy of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau loan\ninformation booklet to the applicant.

Many states\nrequire persons who manage real estate on behalf of other persons or entities to\nbe licensed as real estate brokers. Other states license such persons specifically as\nproperty managers. Real estate firms that handle the sale of commercial and\ninvestment properties are in a natural position to manage those properties for\ntheir owners. Some property managers work for firms that manage multiple\nproperties under blanket management contracts. Others are independent agents.\nSome are employees of the owner. They generally fall into one of the following\ncategories:\n\uf034 individual property manager-- usually a real estate broker who\nmanages properties for one for one or more owners; may belong to\na small property management firm devoted to full-time property\nmanagement, be self-employed, or be one of several managers in a\nlarge real estate firm.\n\uf034 individual building manager-- usually manages a single large\nproperty; may be employed by a property manager or directly by\nan owner; may or may not have a real estate license.\n\uf034 resident manager (residential properties only)-- lives on the\nproperty and may be employed by a real estate broker, a\nmanaging agent or an owner to manage a property on a part-\ntime or full-time basis; may be required by state law for\nproperties of certain types and sizes.\nA manager has a fiduciary relationship with the principal and, in general, is\ncharged with producing the greatest possible net return on the owner's investment\nwhile safeguarding the value of the investment for the owner/investor. At the same\ntime, the manager has some responsibilities to tenants, who want the best value\n380 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "and the best space for their money. Professional managers are therefore much\nmore than rent collectors. They need technical expertise in marketing,\naccounting, finance, and construction. Property managers often specialize in one\ntype of property - apartment, office, retail, industrial, farm, single-family-and\nacquire specialized knowledge of that property type. Whatever the property type\nand management arrangement, the manager's work involves leasing, managing,\nmarketing, and maintaining the property. The services a manager provides thus\ncan be seen to fall into three areas: financial, physical, and administrative.\nSpecific functions, duties, and responsibilities are determined by the management\nagreement, although most agreements will include at least the following\nfunctions.\nReporting Financial reporting to the principal is a fundamental responsibility of the\nproperty manager. Reports may be required monthly, quarterly, and annually.\nRequired reports typically include an annual operating budget (see below);\nmonthly cash flow reports indicating income, expenses, net operating income,\nand net cash flow; profit and loss statements based on the cash flow reports and\nshowing net profit; and budget comparison statements showing how actual\nresults match the original budget.\nBudgeting An operating budget based on expected expenses and revenues is a necessity\nfor management. The budget will determine rental rates, amounts available for\ncapital expenditures, required reserve funds, salaries and wages of employees,\namounts to be paid for property taxes and insurance premiums and mortgage or\ndebt service. It will indicate the expected return, based on the previous year's\nperformance. A typical budget will contain a projection, also based on past\nperformance and on current market information, of income from all sources,\nsuch as rents and other services, and of expenses for all purposes, such as\noperating expenses, maintenance services, utilities, taxes, and capital\nexpenditures. Operating statements itemizing income and expenses are then\npresented to the owner on a regular basis so that the owner can evaluate the\nmanager's performance against the budget.\nIncome. The total of scheduled rents plus revenues from such sources as\nvending services, storage charges, late fees, utilities, and contracts is the\npotential gross income. Subtracting losses caused by uncollected rents,\nvacancies and evictions gives effective gross income. Operating expenses are\nsubtracted from this total to show net operating income. When debt service and\nreserves (which are not counted as operating expenses) are subtracted, the result\nis cash flow.\nExpenses. Expenses may be fixed or variable. Fixed expenses are those that\nremain constant and may include operating expenses, regular maintenance\ncosts, and administration. Variable expenses are those that may change from\nmonth to month or occur sporadically, such as specific repairs or capital\nexpenditures.\nCapital expenditures. Expected expenditures for major items such as\nrenovation or expansion should be included as a budgeting item. Large-scale\nprojects are typically budgeted over a period of years.\nChapter 23: Property Management 381",

The amount of\nthe reserve is based on experience with variable expenses in previous years.\nRenting The property manager, whose full responsibilities include maintaining and\nmanaging the property in accordance with the owner's financial goals, include\nseeing that the property is properly rented and tenanted. The manager may use\nthe services of a leasing agent, whose concern is solely to rent the space. In such\na situation, some of the manager's tasks may be performed by the leasing agent.\nRenting the property includes the following tasks, regardless of which party is\nactually performing them.\nControlling vacancies. There are many possible reasons for vacancies in a\nbuilding:\n\uf034 rent too high or too low\n\uf034 ineffective marketing\n\uf034 management quality\n\uf034 poor tenant-retention program\n\uf034 image and appearance problems\n\uf034 high market vacancy rate\nSuccessful managers look for these factors and take steps to limit or counteract\ntheir effects.\nMarketing. Finding and attracting the right kind of tenants for a property is the\naim of a marketing program. A marketing plan based on the property's features\nand the relationship between supply and demand in the market area, and\nconsonant with the money available, will determine the best mix of advertising\nand promotional activities. Marketing methods include:\n\uf034 billboard advertising\n\uf034 brochures and fliers\n\uf034 meetings and presentations\n\uf034 networking\n\uf034 newspaper ads\n\uf034 radio and television advertising\n\uf034 signs\n\uf034 tenant referrals\n\uf034 websites and online services\nThe efficiency of marketing activities can be judged in terms of how many\nprospects per completed lease they generate. The lower the cost per prospect per\nlease, the more effective and efficient the program.\nSetting rents. Rental income must be sufficient to cover fixed expenses, operating\nexpenses, and desired return on investment. But rental rates must also be realistic,\ntaking into account what is happening in the market. The manager must consider\nprevailing rents in comparable properties as well as vacancy rates in the market\nand in the property. The manager makes a detailed survey of competitive space\n382 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Residential\napartment rates are stated in monthly amounts per unit, while commercial rates\nare usually stated as an annual or monthly amount per square foot. If vacancy\nrates in the managed property are too high, the manager may have to lower\nrates or identify problems in the property or its management that are\ncontributing to vacancy level. On the other hand, if the property's vacancy rate\nis significantly lower than market rates, the manager may conclude that higher\nrental rates are called for.\nSelecting tenants. To ensure that the property produces the desired level of\nincome from rent, it is essential to find the most suitable tenants. For commercial\nspace, the manager must determine that:\n\uf034 the space meets the tenant's needs for size, configuration, location,\nand quality.\n\uf034 the tenant will be able to pay for the space.\n\uf034 the tenant's business is compatible with that of other tenants.\n\uf034 there is room for expansion if the tenant's need for space is likely\nto grow.\nFor residential space, in addition to ascertaining the tenant's creditworthiness, the\nmanager must be careful to comply with all federal and local fair housing laws. A\nmanager should collect the same type of information on all prospective tenants.\nHowever, even though the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex,\nage and other protected classes, a manager may discriminate in certain other\nways. For example, a manager has the right to refuse to rent to a person who has\na history paying rent late, damaging property, fighting with other tenants, or\nspotty employment.\nCollecting rents. The lease agreement should clearly specify the terms of rental\npayment. The manager must establish a system of notices and records as well as a\nmethod of collecting rents on schedule. Compliance with all state laws and\nregulations concerning collecting and accounting for rents is a necessity to avoid\nunwanted legal complications. As for monies received, the manager must follow\ntrust fund handling procedures established by law and laid out in the rental and\nmanagement agreements. If authorized by the management agreement, the\nmanager may also collect security deposits and handle them as required by law.\nMaintaining tenant relations. Happy tenants remain in a rented space longer\nthan unhappy tenants. High tenant turnover adds to increased advertising and\nredecorating expenses. For these reasons, it is incumbent on the manager to\n\uf034 communicate regularly with tenants\n\uf034 respond promptly and satisfactorily to maintenance and service\nrequests\n\uf034 enforce rules and lease terms consistently and fairly\n\uf034 comply with all relevant laws, such as fair housing and ADA\n(Americans with Disabilities Act) regulations\nChapter 23: Property Management 383",

They ensure that persons\nreceive fair treatment regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, sex,\nhandicap, or familial status. Families with children must receive equal treatment\nwith those who do not have children. Landlords cannot charge higher rents or\nsecurity deposits because of the presence of children. Managers must make sure\nthat their marketing and leasing practices are in accordance with fair housing laws.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act similarly requires landlords in certain\ncircumstances to make housing and facilities available to disabled persons\nwithout hindrance. Familiarity with this law and with the latest state, federal, and\nlocal fair housing laws is essential.\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination in lending,\napplies to how property managers evaluate potential tenants. The manager must be\nconsistent in evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants. The same application\nforms and the same credit requirements should be used with all applicants.\nProperty\nmaintenance Physical maintenance of the property is one of the property manager's primary\nfunctions. The costs of services provided must always be balanced with financial\nobjectives and the need to satisfy tenant needs. The manager will also be\nconcerned with staffing and scheduling requirements, in accordance with\nmaintenance objectives.\nMaintenance objectives. The foremost maintenance objective is generally to\npreserve the value of the physical asset for the owner over the long term. Although\nnot every property is best served by vast expenditures on top-level maintenance, it\nis almost always important to maintain the viability of the property as a rental.\nThree general types of maintenance are required to keep a property in serviceable\ncondition: routine, preventive, and corrective.\nRoutine maintenance. Routine maintenance activities are those necessary for the\nday-to-day functioning of the property. Regular performance of these activities\nhelps to keep tenants satisfied as well as forestall serious problems requiring\nrepair or correction. Routine activities are such things as:\n\uf034 regular inspections\n\uf034 scheduled upkeep of mechanical systems-heating, air-\nconditioning, rest rooms, lighting, landscaping\n\uf034 regular cleaning of common areas\n\uf034 minor repairs\n\uf034 supervision of purchasing\nPreventive maintenance. Preventive maintenance goes beyond the routine in\nattempting to deal with situations that can become serious problems if ignored.\nSeasonal or scheduled replacement of appliances and equipment, regular painting\nof exterior and interior areas, and planned replacement of a roof are a few\nexamples.\n384 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

A boiler\nmay develop a leak, an air-conditioning unit may break down, an elevator may\ncease to function properly.\nMaintenance contracting. Depending on building type and size, tenant needs,\nand budgetary constraints, a manager may decide to hire an outside firm to\nhandle maintenance services rather than hiring on-site employees. Efficiency,\ncompetence, responsiveness, and effective cost will be major deciding factors.\nConstruction Commercial and industrial property managers are regularly called upon to make\nalterations to existing space to accommodate a tenant's needs. They may also\nhave to undertake or oversee construction that alters or expands common areas or\nthe entire building itself. Again, such work may be contracted out or done by in-\nhouse employees.\nTenant improvements. Alterations made specifically for certain tenants are\ncalled build-outs or tenant improvements. The work may involve merely painting\nand re-carpeting a rental space, or erecting new walls and installing special\nelectrical or other systems. In new buildings, spaces are often left incomplete so\nthat they can be finished to an individual tenant's specifications. In such cases, it\nis important to clarify which improvements will be considered tenant property\n(trade fixtures) and which will belong to the building.\nRenovations. When buildings lose functionality (become functionally\nobsolescent), they generally also lose tenants, drop in class, and suffer declining\nrental rates. Maintenance becomes more expensive because of the difficulties of\nservicing out-of-date building components. Renovation may solve some of these\nproblems, but the manager will have to help the owner determine whether the\ncosts of renovation can be recovered by increased revenues resulting from the\nrenovation.\nEnvironmental concerns. A variety of environmental concerns confronts a\nproperty manager, ranging from air quality to waste disposal, tenant concerns,\nand federal, state and local environmental regulations. The managed property\nmay contain asbestos, radon, mold, lead, and other problematic substances.\nTenants may produce hazardous waste. The manager must be aware of the issues\nand see that proper procedures are in place to deal with them, including providing\nmeans for proper disposal of hazardous materials, arranging for environmental\naudits and undertaking possible remediation. For instance, an audit may show\nthat a building is causing tenants to become sick because of off-gassing from\nconstruction materials combined with a lack of ventilation. Remediation may\nconsist of nothing more than replacing carpets and improving ventilation, and the\nmanager, if empowered to do so, should take the necessary steps.\nLegal concerns (ADA). The Americans with Disabilities Act requires managers to\nensure that disabled employees and members of the public have the same level of\naccess to facilities as is provided for those who are not disabled. Employers with\nat least fifteen employees must follow nondiscriminatory employment and hiring\npractices. Reasonable accommodations must be made to enable disabled\nemployees to perform essential functions of their jobs. Modifications to the\nChapter 23: Property Management 385",

Existing barriers must be removed when the removal is \"readily\nachievable,\" that is, when cost is not prohibitive. New construction and\nremodeling must meet a higher standard, Managers must be aware of the laws\nand determine whether their buildings meet requirements. If not, the manager\nmust determine whether restructuring or retrofitting or some other kind of\naccommodation is most practical.\nRisk management Many things can go wrong in a rented property, from natural disaster to personal\ninjury to terrorism to malfeasance by employees. Huge monetary losses for the\nowner, in the form of civil and criminal penalties, legal costs, fines, damages, and\ncosts of remediation can be the result. A manager must consider the possibility of\nsuch events and have a plan for dealing with them.\nRisk management strategies. Depending on the nature of the risk, the size of the\npotential losses, the likelihood of its happening, and the costs of doing something\nabout it, a manager and owner will generally choose one or more of the following\nrisk management strategies:\n\uf034 avoidance-removing the source of the risk, such as by closing off a\ndangerous area of the building\n\uf034 reduction-taking action to forestall the event before it happens,\nsuch as by installing fire alarms, sprinklers, and security systems\n\uf034 transference-shifting the risk to someone else by buying an\ninsurance policy\n\uf034 retention-taking the chance that the event is not likely enough to\noccur to justify the expense of one of the other strategies; self-\ninsurance\nSecurity and safety. A court may hold a manager and owner responsible for\nthe physical safety of employees, tenants, and customers in leased premises. In\naddition to standard life safety and security systems such as sprinklers, fire\ndoors, smoke alarms, fire escapes, and door locks, a manager may have to\nprovide electronic and human monitoring systems (security cameras, security\nguards) and be prepared to take action against tenants who allow, conduct or\ncontribute to dangerous criminal activities such as assault and drug use.\nInsurance. Many types of insurance are available to allow for the shifting of\nliability away from the owner. An insurance audit by a competent insurance\nagent will indicate what kind of and how much coverage is advisable. Common\ntypes of insurance coverage for income and commercial properties include:\n\uf034 casualty-coverage for specific risks, such as theft, vandalism,\nburglary, illness and accident, machinery damage\n386 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Current\nreplacement value, which is more expensive, is the amount it would cost to\nrebuild or replace the property at current rates.\nCommercial policies include coinsurance clauses requiring the insured to bear a\nportion of the loss.

An estate for years may be for any definite period\u2014years, months,\nweeks, days. When the estate expires, the lessee must return the premises to the\nlessor and vacate the premises. Most commercial leases grant this type of estate.\nPeriodic. An estate from period-to-period does not have any definite period.\nSuch an estate begins as a lease for a definite period but continues after the\nexpiration of the lease, as long as the lessee continues to pay rent at the regular\ninterval, the lessor accepts it, and no one gives notice to terminate the lease. This\ntype of leasehold is common with residential properties.\nAt will. A tenancy at will is similar to the periodic tenancy, except that it does\nnot begin with a definite period. It continues, with the consent of the lessor, as\nlong as the tenant pays rent at regular intervals. It is terminated by the death of\neither party. The tenancy at will is rarely, if ever, used in a written lease.\nAt sufferance. A tenancy or estate at sufferance comes into existence when a\ntenant stays beyond the expiration of another type of lease without the lessor\u2019s\npermission. This type of tenancy is never intentionally used in a written lease.\nLeases, depending on how rent is determined, are also defined as gross, net,\npercentage leases, and graduated leases.\nGross. In a gross lease, the tenant pays an established, fixed rent, and the\nlandlord pays all property operating expenses, such as taxes, insurance, utilities,\nand other services. This is the arrangement commonly used in residential leases.\nNet. Net leases have the tenant paying rent plus some or all of the operating\nexpenses attributable to the rented space. This arrangement is commonly used in\noffice and industrial leases.\nPercentage. A percentage lease may be gross or net, but the rent is not fixed, but\ndepends on the income generated by the tenant in the leased property. A common\narrangement is to set a fixed base rent plus a percentage of the tenant\u2019s gross\nincome or sales at the site. The percentage calculation may take effect only\n392 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "when the income reaches a certain level. This arrangement is commonly used in\nretail leases.\nGraduated. Either a gross or a net lease may also be a graduated lease, in which\nthe rental rate increases at specified times over the lease term.\nOwned and leased\ninclusions The lease should set forth items that are excluded or included in the leased\nproperty. For instance, a residential lease may include built-in appliances such as\ndishwashers but exclude freestanding ones, such as refrigerators. Furniture may\nbe included or excluded. At issue for the landlord is the cost of maintenance. If a\nrefrigerator is not included, it does not have to be maintained by the property\nmanager.\nOwnership also relates to insurance policies: one can only insure what one owns,\nso if a property item is destroyed by fire, the owner's policy will not provide any\ncoverage for an item that is not included in the lease as belonging to the property.\nThis may be of critical importance in a commercial lease where certain\nimprovements might be owned by either the landlord or the tenant, according to\nthe lease.\nThe lease should also have clear rules about making alterations. If the tenant is\nnot satisfied with an item that is part of the property, the lease may provide for\nthe tenant to make changes only with permission or with the obligation to return\nthe premises to their original condition on termination, or that any alterations\nmade to fixtures become the property of the landlord. Trade fixtures, by\ndefinition, belong to the tenant and can be removed when the tenant leaves.\nInclusions may also be of a financial nature-what is included in the rent. Principal\nand interest on a mortgage loan, homeowner's association dues, common area\nmaintenance charges, liability and hazard insurance, and various operating\nexpenses are items that might be included in the lease as the owner's or the\ntenant's responsibilities.\nReversionary rights\nof owners Like the grantor of a life estate, the grantor of a leasehold estate retains a future\ninterest in the estate. The lease grants a number of rights to the property,\nincluding, primarily, the rights to enter, possess, and use the property for the\nterm of the lease. The lessee does not enjoy the full bundle of rights to the\nproperty. For instance, the lessee may not encumber or sell the property. When\nthe lease expires ( a condition subsequent), all rights revert to the original\nowner. A common example is the leasing of an apartment for a one-year period.\nWhen the lease expires, the lessee has no further rights in the property and full\nownership reverts to the lessor. Another condition subsequent that may cause\nreversion of rights is tenant default.\nLandlord rights\nand responsibilities State law, often incorporating or modeling the Universal Residential Landlord\nTenant Act (see below) prescribes rights and responsibilities for residential\nlandlords and tenants.\nRights. Commonly, the landlord retains a right of entry into the premises in order\nto perform needed repairs and maintenance on a property. The lease and/or the\nlaw may specify that a landlord may enter the tenant's property only under one or\nmore of the following conditions:\nChapter 23: Property Management 393",

At the end of the lease term, the landlord has the\nright to retake possession of the premises. In case of tenant breach or default, the\nlandlord has the right to pursue the remedies provided by law, such as eviction, to\ntake possession.\nResponsibilities. The landlord (by way of the property manager), is expected to\ndeliver a property that is habitable. This means that the landlord at the very least\nmust:\n\uf034 keep the heating, cooling, electrical, and plumbing systems in good\nworking condition\n\uf034 keep floors, stairways and railings safe and in good repair\n\uf034 provide pest control as needed\n\uf034 repair roof leaks and broken windows promptly.\nTenant rights\nand responsibilities Rights. Beyond the right to quiet enjoyment (privacy) of a property received and\nmaintained in a habitable condition, the tenant has other rights, depending on\nstate law. For instance, a tenant may be able to take any of the following actions\nif a landlord fails to correct a problem that is the landlord's responsibility:\n\uf034 move out without liability for back rent or the unexpired portion of\nthe lease\n\uf034 refer the problem to mediation, arbitration or small claims court\n\uf034 after giving the owner written notification of an emergency\nsituation, call a professional repair person and deduct the cost\nfrom the next month's rent.\nResponsibilities.

The landlord must serve notice on the tenant a specified number of\ndays before beginning the eviction suit. A court issues a judgment for possession,\nwhich requires the tenant to vacate. A court officer, such as a sheriff, may\nforcibly remove the tenant and possessions if the tenant refuses to vacate. The\nlandlord can then enter and take possession.\nA constructive eviction occurs when a tenant vacates the leased premises and\ndeclares the lease void, claiming that the landlord's actions have made the\npremises unfit for the purpose described in the lease. The tenant must prove that\nit was the landlord's actions that were responsible and may be able to recover\ndamages.\nTenant\nimprovements As discussed earlier, leased spaces are often modified to a tenant's specifications.\nSuch alternations may be made by the landlord on the tenant's behalf or by the\ntenant. Buildings usually have \"standard\" improvements, which any tenant\nimprovements must equal or improve on. Many leases have a clause that requires\nthe tenant to return the premises to the condition in which they were received at\nthe end of the lease term. Who pays for improvements and who owns them are\nmajor matters for negotiation.\nTermination of\na lease Like contracts in general, leases may terminate in a number of ways. Principal\namong these are the following. See the chapters on leases and contract law for\nmore information.\nExpiration. A lease with a term (estate for years) automatically expires at the\nend of the term.\nPerformance. Any contract terminates when all parties have performed their\nobligations.\nAgreement. The parties may agree to terminate the lease before the end of the\nterm.\nAbandonment. The landlord may retake possession and pursue the tenant for\ndefault if the tenant abandons the premises and fails to fulfill lease obligations.\nThe tenant's obligation to pay rent continues.\nDefault or Breach. A default occurs when either the tenant or landlord violates\nany of the terms or covenants of the lease. The damaged party may sue for\ndamages, specific performance (of the breached obligation), or cancellation of the\nlease. When the default arises from the tenant's failure to pay rent or maintain the\npremises, the landlord may sue for possession and for eviction. Before filing suit,\nthe landlord must give proper notice and allow the tenant to remedy the breach.\nThe most common form of landlord default is failure to maintain the property and\nprovide services. The tenant may vacate the premises and declare the lease\nChapter 23: Property Management 395",

A periodic leasehold or tenancy at will may be terminated by proper\nnotice given by either party.\nDestruction. Property destruction is grounds for termination of the lease.\nCondemnation. Eminent domain proceedings terminate leases.\nForeclosure. Foreclosure actions terminate lease obligations.\nDeath. A tenancy at will terminates on the death of either party. The landlord's\ndeath terminates any lease if the landlord held the leased property under a life\nestate, since the landlord cannot convey an interest that extends beyond the\nlandlord's life.\nSecurity deposit\nProcedures As previously mentioned in the context of handling trust funds, state laws, real\nestate commission rules, and the state\u2019s real estate law, usually specify how a\nproperty manager is to manage security deposits. Such funds are normally held in\na special trust account and may not be used for any purpose other than the\nintended one. Whether the deposit can earn interest, and to whom that interest\nbelongs, are likewise prescribed by law. The law also prescribes when the deposit\nmust be returned to the tenant, and under what circumstances any of it may be\nwithheld. The contract language should clearly state the rules, among other\nthings, governing what happens to the deposit when the lease terminates.\nUniform Residential\nLandlord-Tenant Act The Uniform Residential Landlord-Tenant Act is model legislation that has been\nadopted to a greater or lessor extent in many states. In addition to addressing fair\nand equitable remedies for breaches by both landlord and tenant, the act aims to\nclarify imprecise language in residential leases that can lead to confusion or\nexploitation in such areas as:\n\uf034 lease term\n\uf034 rental amount\n\uf034 security deposit\n\uf034 landlord access\n\uf034 procedures for default and eviction\n\uf034 general obligations of landlord and tenant.\nSee the chapter on \"Real Estate Leases\" for more detail.\n396 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The plan will take into account market indicators such as vacancy rates,\noccupancy rates, absorption rates, and new supply coming onto the market.

The base of a triangle, square, or rectangle may be any side; a trapezoid\nhas two bases, its two parallel sides.\n3. The height of a triangle is the length of a perpendicular line from the base\nto the triangle's opposite point. Height in a square, rectangle or trapezoid\nis the length of a line which is perpendicular to the base line(s).\n404 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The Commission's role is to serve and protect the\npublic through the licensing and regulating of real estate professionals. The\nAREC enforces Alabama license laws which were created to regulate real estate\nprofessionals and the practice of real estate business. The AREC also creates and\nenforces its own rules to further regulate the practice of real estate business in\nAlabama.\nThe 1927 Act was expanded by the Real Estate License Law of 1951 and then\namended in 1953, 1963, and 1982 to further regulate real estate licensing.\nCommission key\ncharacteristics The Commission is made up of nine commissioners who are appointed by the\nGovernor with the advice and consent of the State Senate. The appointments are\nmade from a list of three persons nominated by the Alabama Professional Real\nEstate Society or trade association. The appointment is to be made within 30 days\nof receiving the list, or the Society will provide a second list of three persons,\ngiving the Governor six names from which to appoint one commissioner. At least\none of the names submitted must not be a member of the Society or trade\nassociation.\nThe nine members of the Commission consist of seven members who must have\nbeen residents and citizens of Alabama for at least 10 years and must also have\nbeen real estate brokers or salespersons for at least 10 years. Commissioners may\nnot have been convicted of federal or state license law violations. Each member\nmust also be from different U.S. Congressional Districts. Members serve 5-year\nstaggered terms and may not serve more than two consecutive terms. They do,\nhowever, remain in office until a successor is appointed and confirmed.

The\nlegal action can be taken even if an adequate legal remedy does not exist or there\nis no proof that irreparable damage would result from the continued violation.\nIf the accused party or entity is unlicensed and engaging in activities which\nrequire licensure, the Commission may issue an order to cease and desist the\nactivities. The executive director will issue the order after the Commission staff\nfinds probable cause. The order will become final 15 days after service unless the\naccused requests a hearing before the AREC. If the hearing results in the finding\nof a violation, the cease and desist order may become final and the Commission\nmay impose an appropriate fine for each violation. The Commission may also\nimpose a fine in the amount of any gain or economic benefit that resulted from\nthe violation, as well as a fine in the amount of the costs incurred by the\nCommission. Unpaid fines are enforceable in any court with competent\njurisdiction and venue.\nThe Commission may choose not to issue an order to cease and desist but may\ngive proper notice to the accused and hold a hearing. If the hearing results in a\nguilty verdict, the penalties will be the same as discussed in the previous\nparagraph where a cease and desist order was issued.\nActions which constitute violations will be covered in detail in a later chapter.\nRehearing An accused party associated with a case heard by the Commission may file an\napplication for rehearing if the individual does not agree with the Commission's\nfindings. The application must specify the grounds for the rehearing and must be\nfiled within 30 days of receiving notice of the Commission's decision.\n434 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The\nappealing party must file a complaint that explains the issues to be appealed\nwithin 30 days of the appeal notice being filed.

However, sometimes the licensee does not pay any or all of the\ndamages, so the complainant may not be fully compensated for the damages. To\naddress this situation, Alabama law requires the AREC to establish and maintain\na Recovery Fund.\nPurpose of the\nfund The Recovery Fund was established to assist an aggrieved party in recovering\nactual or compensatory damages not paid by the licensee in cases where the\nlicensee has been ordered to pay such damages. The damages must have been\nsustained within Alabama and must have been the result of conduct of a broker or\nsalesperson that is in violation of Article 1 or 2 of the Alabama License Law or\nof AREC rules. The Recovery Fund is not used to pay interest or court costs.\nPayment into the\nfund The Recovery Fund is funded by a fee of $30 paid by each applicant for an\noriginal broker or salesperson license. This fee is in addition to any other fee paid\nby the applicant. The $30 is deposited into the Recovery Fund. If the\nCommission does not issue the applicant's license, the fee is refunded to the\napplicant.\nIf a salesperson pays the Recovery Fund fee at the time he or she applies for the\nsalesperson license, he or she is not obligated to pay the fee again if/when\napplying for a broker license. If the salesperson does pay the fee a second time,\nhe or she can request a refund of the extra Recovery Fund fee paid.\nThe Recovery Fund fee is only paid once at the time of application for an original\nbroker or salesperson license, unless the Fund's balance drops below the\nminimum required.\nMonies received for the Recovery Fund are to be deposited into the State\nTreasury and held in the Recovery Fund in trust by the AREC. The funds may be\ninvested by the State Treasurer in any investments that domestic life insurance\ncompanies may legally invest in under Alabama law.\nAny interest or income from the investments is to be deposited into the Real\nEstate Commission Revenue Fund, with half of the deposited monies being\n436 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

At least 80% of the course hours must be\npresented by live instruction unless the course is an Association of Real Estate\nLicense Law Officials (ARELLO) certified distance education course.\nThe student must then apply for and schedule the salesperson license state\nexamination. Applicants must pass the examination within 6 months after the\ncompletion date of the pre-license course. Failure to meet the time frame\n446 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Within 90 days after passing the\nlicense examination, the applicant must find an Alabama-licensed qualifying\nbroker under whose supervision the salesperson applicant will work. The\nqualifying broker must sign and submit a sworn statement of his or her belief of\nthe applicant's honesty, trustworthiness, and good reputation and of the broker's\nwillingness to accept responsibility for the salesperson's actions.\nAfter passing the examination, securing the qualifying broker, and meeting all\nother requirements for licensure, including paying the $30 Recovery Fund fee,\nthe applicant will be issued a temporary license certificate. The temporary\nlicense is valid for 1 year.\nPost-license education. During the 12 months of temporary licensure, the\nsalesperson must complete a 30-hour post-license course, apply for an original\nsalesperson license, and pay all associated application fees. The salesperson\nshould complete the post-license course and apply for the original license within\nthe first 6 months of temporary licensure. If the salesperson does not complete\nthe course within the first 6 months, the license will automatically be placed on\ninactive status. The salesperson then has the remaining 6 months to complete the\ncourse and apply for an original license. If the salesperson fails to complete the\npost-license course within 12 months, the temporary license will automatically\nexpire and lapse. Temporary licenses may not be renewed.\nHolding a temporary license is required for enrollment in the post-license\ncourse. As with the pre-license course, a 90% attendance rate is required in live\ninstruction courses.\nOriginal licensure Application process. After completing the post-license course, salespersons\nholding a temporary license must apply for an original license on or before the\ndate the temporary license expires.\nThe salesperson must submit the original license application, appropriate fees,\nand proof of completion of the post-license course to the Alabama Real Estate\nCommission on or before midnight on the last day of the month 1 year from the\nissuance of the temporary license.\nFor example, if Joe was issued a temporary license on April 4, 2027, he must\napply for his original license by midnight on April 30, 2028. Joe must also have\ncompleted the post-license course and paid the license fee prior to that date and\ntime. However, keep in mind that Joe could obtain his original license sooner if\nhe completes the post-license course during the first 6 months he has his\ntemporary license. Otherwise, his temporary license will be placed on inactive\nstatus after the first 6 months and will remain inactive until he completes the\ncoursework. If he doesn't complete the post-license course and apply for his\noriginal license within the 12 months, his temporary license will lapse, and he\nwill have to start the entire process all over again.\nChapter 26: Alabama Licensing Regulation 447",

Therefore,\nusing the above example, if Joe paid the Recovery Fund fee when he applied for\nhis temporary license, he is not required to pay it again when he applies for his\noriginal license.\nLicense renewal All licenses, including inactive licenses, must be renewed to remain current. A\nlicense may be renewed by filing an AREC license renewal form or by utilizing\nthe renewal option available at www.arec.alabama.gov. The licensee must also\npay a renewal fee and complete continuing education courses prior to renewal.\nIf the licensee is on active status, the Commission will mail the renewal form to\nthe licensee's place of business. If the licensee is on inactive status, the form will\nbe mailed to the licensee's residence. The Commission will mail the form prior to\nAugust 1 of the final year of the license period. If the licensee does not receive\nthe form by August 1, he or she must notify the AREC by August 10. The form\nmay only be used for license renewal and not for any other reason, such as a\nlicense transfer.\nRenewal dates. The license period is 2 years, ending in even numbered years.\nThe license will expire at midnight on September 30 of the final year of the 2-\nyear license period. Renewals and renewal fees are due by August 31 of the final\nyear of the license period. Licenses renewed between September 1 and\nSeptember 30 will be charged a late renewal penalty in addition to the renewal\nfee. Licenses not renewed by September 30 will expire and be placed on inactive\nstatus on October 1.\nBecause the license period always ends in an even numbered year, the license\nmust be renewed in the next even numbered year, regardless of when it was\nissued. For example, if the license was issued in April 2025, it would need to be\nrenewed in 2026, the next even numbered year. Similarly, if a license was\noriginally issued in April 2026, the license would need to be renewed that same\nyear because 2026 is an even numbered year.\nExpired licenses may still be renewed during the 12 months following the\nexpiration date. If the license is not renewed during this 12-month period, the\nlicense will lapse. The individual will then need to meet all the same\nrequirements of licensure applicable to individuals who have never been licensed\nand reapply for licensure.\nBy not renewing the license by the September 30 deadline and then by allowing\nthe license to lapse after the 12-month renewal period, the individual will no\nlonger be considered a licensee and will no longer receive correspondence from\nthe AREC.\nUnder certain circumstances, the Commission may determine the existence of a\nhardship for the licensee and allow an extended renewal date with payment of\nrenewal fees and penalties.\nIn addition to submitting the license renewal form and renewal fees, as well as\nrenewal penalties if applicable, the licensee must submit proof of completion of\napproved continuing education courses.\n448 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The other common entity defined as a company\nis a branch office. Alabama license law requires every qualifying broker and\nevery place of business to have a company license.\nLicense application. The company's qualifying broker is responsible for\napplying for a company license or branch office license. The application must be\nmade on an AREC-approved form. Branch office licenses use a special\napplication form because the law requires that the branch qualifying broker and\nthe main company qualifying broker both share responsibility for the actions at\nthe branch office.\nThe qualifying broker is required to be an officer, partner, or employee of the\ncompany.\nThe company license applicant must maintain a place of business. If the applicant\nmaintains more than one place of business in Alabama, he or she needs a\ncompany or branch office license for each location or branch office. The\ncompany must meet the following requirements for licensure:\n\uf034 the application must include the location of the company or branch\noffice and the name of its qualifying broker\n\uf034 each company or branch office must be under the direction and\nsupervision of a qualifying broker who is licensed at the company\nor branch office address\n\uf034 each company or branch office must have its own qualifying broker\nwith no qualifying broker serving more than one location\n\uf034 the branch office qualifying broker and the company qualifying\nbroker are to share equal responsibility for the activities of all\nlicensees assigned to the branch office or company\nEvery activity that requires a real estate license must be performed in the name of\nthe licensed company under the qualifying broker.

Bob has several\nassociate brokers who want to manage property, so they decide to manage\nproperty on their own and not under Bob. Bob has told them he doesn't care as\nlong as he doesn't have to deal with the activities. Bob has also told them that\nthey cannot use the company name when offering and performing the property\nmanagement services.\nThis seems workable for all involved, right?

To serve as a qualifying broker, the\nindividual must be an Alabama-licensed broker with real estate being his or her\nprincipal business. The individual must also be in a position to supervise the real\nestate activities of any associate broker or salesperson registered to that office.\nServing as a qualifying broker is a full time position, so the individual must be\navailable to serve full time.\nResponsibilities of\nqualifying broker Salespersons and associate brokers must be licensed under a qualifying broker\nwho is then responsible for real estate activities in which the salesperson or\nassociate broker engage. The qualifying broker is also responsible for all real\nestate activities of the company for which he or she is the qualifying broker.\nThe qualifying broker must also assure that all transactions performed by any\nlicensee or company for which he or she is responsible comply with Alabama\nlicense law and AREC rules.\nIf a licensee or company for which the qualifying broker is responsible violates\nany of these laws or rules, the qualifying broker will be held responsible to the\ninjured party for any damage caused by the violation. The qualifying broker's\nliability will be in addition to the licensee's own liability for such violations.\nThe qualifying broker is also responsible for displaying the current licenses for\nall companies, branch offices, brokers, and salespersons under his or her\nsupervision.

The broker and licensee may\nestablish such a relationship, but the law does not automatically establish it for\nthem.\nBroker supervision One of the primary responsibilities of a qualifying broker is proper supervision of\nthe broker\u2019s company and of those licensed under the broker. Proper supervision\nincludes, but is not limited to, the following:\n1) maintain an active broker\u2019s license with the Commission\n2) prevent unlicensed persons from engaging in activities requiring a license on\nbehalf of the qualifying broker or company\n3) prevent a licensee from conducting licensed activity for a company under\nwhich the licensee is not licensed\n4) prevent a person whose license is expired, inactive, pending transfer\nsuspended, or revoked from engaging in licensed activities\n5) ensure that licensees comply with any restrictions placed on their licenses\n6) refrain from causing licensees to violate a state, federal, or local law or\nregulation while conducting licensed activity\nChapter 27: Alabama Brokerage Regulation 463",

The account is set up by the brokerage company's qualifying broker at a\nfederally insured banking institution that is located in Alabama. The funds are\nheld until such a time that a specific event, such as a real estate closing, takes\nplace.\nPurpose When a property is being purchased, the buyer provides earnest money to the\nbroker to be held until the purchase closes. These earnest funds are to be\ndeposited into a bank account other than the broker's business or personal\naccount.\nThis trust fund account keeps the client's money separate from the broker's\nmoney. This ensures that any money the client needs to use for the real estate\ntransaction is in a secure account that is accessible only by the client or the\nbroker. As long as the money is held in a trust account in a bank insured by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), each client's funds are insured up\nto $250,000.\nTrust funds defined Alabama license law and AREC rules require a real estate licensee to deposit and\naccount for all funds belonging to or being held for others at all times. These\nfunds include earnest money, security deposits, and all other funds related to a\ncontract for the sale or lease of property or a property management agreement.\nThey are money or other items of value that the broker receives on behalf of an\nindividual (usually the property buyer) to be held for the benefit of others in\nrelation to any acts for which a real estate license is required.\nThe funds may be U.S. currency (cash), checks, notes, other recognized forms of\nmoney, or other items of value. Cash is to be deposited immediately. Checks may\nbe held for a specific length of time before being deposited if the purchase offer\ndesignates the length of time or the event that must occur prior to the check being\ndeposited. If the offer does not state a specific time for the check to be deposited,\nit is to be deposited when the offer becomes a contract.\n466 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Thus, the qualifying broker is the trustee for the account.\nIf a purchase contract involves more than one qualifying broker, any of the\nqualifying brokers involved in the sale may deposit and hold the funds related to\nthe purchase.\nFunds being held in relation to a purchase contract, a lease, or a property\nmanagement agreement are to be deposited and held by the qualifying broker\nwho is providing these services to the property owner. If the services are\nprovided by a secondary or successor broker, the first broker is to provide a\ncomplete accounting of the funds to the successor qualifying broker and is to\ntransfer the funds to the successor broker.\nThe qualifying broker who is currently providing the services to the owner is\nresponsible to the public and to the Commission for the funds. At the request of\nthe Commission, the current qualifying broker must immediately account for any\ntrust funds he or she holds.\nThe qualifying broker is to be a customer of the bank or financial institution\nwhere the trust account is held and is to be one of the persons with authority to\ndeposit and withdraw funds from the account. He or she may write or make\nchecks as necessary on all trust accounts set up on behalf of the company.\nDisbursement of\ntrust funds The qualifying broker holding the trust funds must disburse the funds to the\nappropriate party or parties within 7 days of the consummation of the transaction\nfor which the funds were being held. In other words, when the purchase is\ncompleted and closed, the funds must be disbursed within 7 days of that closing\ndate.\nIf the transaction does not close or there is disagreement regarding who should\nreceive the funds, the qualifying broker must not disburse any of the funds unless\nthere is a court order or until there is a written agreement signed by all parties.\nAlternatively, the broker may deposit the funds with the appropriate court under\nthe rules of interpleader or any other lawful procedure that is applicable.\nThe rules of interpleader remove the qualifying broker from the disbursement\nprocess and make the disagreeing parties litigate the disbursement between\nthemselves. The qualifying broker becomes the stakeholder, and the disagreeing\nparties become the claimants. The stakeholder then would deposit the funds\nunder dispute with the court, and the court would decide who is legally entitled to\nthe funds. Thus, the qualifying broker is released from any liability regarding\ndisbursement of the funds.\nChapter 27: Alabama Brokerage Regulation 467",

The law has\nalso assigned penalties for failing to perform any of these acts. The law requires\nthe licensee to properly account for or remit money belonging to others that\ncomes into his or her possession. Consequently, licensees must be able to\ncorrectly determine the amount of trust funds they are holding. Failure to do so is\na violation of the law. The law also requires the broker to deposit and account for\nall funds belonging to others or being held for others in a federally insured\naccount in a financial institution located in Alabama. Failure to do so is a\nviolation of the law.\nNo commingling. Further, the licensee is required to maintain trust accounts\nseparate from his or her personal or business accounts to hold funds belonging to\nothers. The trust account may hold funds belonging to multiple clients but not\nfunds belonging to the broker. Failure to separate the broker's funds from the\nfunds belonging to others is called commingling and is a violation of Alabama\nlaw. However, the AREC does allow the broker to keep some personal funds in a\ntrust account to cover bank service charges or check fees.\nThe qualifying broker can lose his or her license if the broker uses any money\nfrom the trust account for his own personal or business use.\nThe broker is not only responsible for his or her own actions, but also for the\nactions of the salespersons and brokers which the qualifying broker supervises.\nThus, the qualifying broker may be held responsible for any commingling,\nembezzling, and conversion of his or her client's money committed by associate\nbrokers or salespersons.\nViolations and discipline. If a licensee violates any of these provisions of the\nlaw pertaining to trust funds and the violation is reported in writing to the AREC,\nthe Commission or its staff may investigate the actions and records of the\nlicensee. Just as with any other violation or complaint, the Commission may issue\nsubpoenas and hear testimony of witnesses and require trust fund records and\ndocuments to be produced during the course of the investigation.\nIf the Commission finds probable cause as a result of the investigation, the\nCommission will file a formal complaint and hold a hearing on the complaint. If\nthe hearing determines the licensee is guilty of an alleged trust fund violation, the\nCommission will impose any or all of the following penalties for each act for\nwhich the licensee is found guilty:\n\uf034 require the licensee to complete continuing education courses in\naddition to the existing CE requirements\n\uf034 suspend or revoke the licensee's license\n\uf034 impose a fine of at least $100 but not more than $5,000\n\uf034 suspend or revoke the license and impose a fine\n\uf034 reprimand the licensee\nThe Commission may suspend or revoke the license until the licensee has\ncompleted an approved continuing education course and/or made restitution to\n468 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

However, it is also\nunfortunately common for electronic hackers and scammers to use the same\ntransfer methods to commit email and wire fraud and obtain funds belonging to\nothers.\nThe scammer typically hacks into an email account or impersonates the email of\na party involved in a real estate transaction.

Typically, neither the\nscammer's bank or the victim's bank will reimburse the funds.\nScammers are targeting licensees, parties to transactions, and even real estate\nsettlement agents in Alabama and across the U.S. The following tips will help\nprotect involved parties from falling victim to these scammers:\n\uf034 never send wire transfer information or any sensitive information\nby email. this includes bank information or routing numbers\n\uf034 include statements in emails that wiring instructions will not be sent\nby email\n\uf034 inform parties involved in the transaction of the scam and ask they\ninform the licensee of any requests involving funds transfers\n\uf034 if funds must be wired, contact the intended recipient on the phone\nand inform them of the intended transfer\n\uf034 do not open suspicious emails or click on suspicious links\n\uf034 be very careful with callers who request username or password\nverification\n\uf034 use passwords that are not easy to guess and then change them on a\nregular basis\n\uf034 keep firewall and antivirus software up to date\nWhile hackers and scammers are becoming more and more sophisticated on ways\nto obtain bank account information, often times simple steps and common sense\ncan thwart their efforts.\nEscrow account\nreconciliation As the trust account holder, the qualifying broker is responsible for depositing\nand accounting for all trust funds in the account. Accounting for the funds\nrequires periodic reconciliation of the broker's records with those of the bank\nholding the accounts.\nChapter 27: Alabama Brokerage Regulation 469",

The records must indicate to whom the\nmoney belongs, the date the money was deposited, the date the money was\nwithdrawn or disbursed, and any other pertinent information.\nReconciliation. The AREC suggests the following as means to reconcile the\naccount records with the bank records:\n\uf034 tape canceled checks into the checkbook next to the check stub to\nmaintain a complete record of the check without having to search\nstatements for the check in question\n\uf034 prepare a continuous list of pending contracts with the amount of\nearnest money involved. mark off each transaction as it closes, as\nthe money is refunded, or as it is forfeited by the buyer or seller\n\uf034 deduct any bank service charges from the account before the\nremainder of the commission is paid to prevent overdraft charges.\nthe AREC allows additional designated funds to be deposited into\nthe account to cover bad checks, services charges, etc.\n\uf034 keep pending contracts separate from closed contracts\n\uf034 maintain a separate escrow account for rental or leased property to\ndistinguish it from sales contracts which will have no\ndisbursements for repairs, owner's payments, etc.\n\uf034 keep written receipts of all funds that are received, whether they are\ncash, check, or other items of value. doing so will provide an\ninternal means of control\nWhile Alabama law does not designate a time frame for account reconciliation,\nmonthly reconciliations are a good course of action to maintain accurate records\nand to stay on top of discrepancies. Balancing the company's account records\nagainst the bank statement should be performed as soon as the statement is\nreceived.\nIf the funds being held are security deposits or rent payments, the licensee should\nmaintain a security deposit escrow account and a rent escrow account to hold the\nfunds belonging to the tenants or to the property owner.\nThe licensee should maintain a continuous ledger that includes all deposits, the\ntenants' names, the property address, the owner's name, the deposit amount, and\nthe date of the deposit. Account ledgers for rent payments should also include a\nrecord of payments to the property owner as proceeds, to the real estate\nmanagement company for their management fees, and invoices for any\nmaintenance.\nThese accounts also should be reconciled monthly with the balances shown in the\nledgers matching with the balances shown on the monthly bank statement for\neach account.\n470 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "ESTIMATED CLOSING STATEMENT\nPurpose for the estimate\nEstimated closing expenditures\nDisclosure to consumer\nA real estate closing is the transfer of the property title from the seller to the\nbuyer in accordance with the sales contract. However, there are numerous costs\nassociated with the closing that can become quite complex. The costs involved\nare determined by the sales contract, local tradition and custom, type of\nfinancing, and local, state, and federal laws.\nThe closing statement. A closing statement is an accounting document used in\nthe real estate transaction closing that details the final costs related to a transfer of\nownership of property. It is also known as a settlement statement.\nWhile the closing statement presents the final settlement costs, buyers and sellers\nneed to know the approximate transaction costs at the time an offer to purchase\nthe property is made. Therefore, the law requires that an estimated closing\nstatement be produced for both the buyer and the seller at the time an offer or\ncounteroffer is made. The estimate approximates settlement costs so that each\nparty will be duly informed and prepared. All parties to the transaction should\ncompare the estimated closing statement to the final closing statement to find and\ncorrect potential errors.\nProviding an estimated closing statement to the buyer and seller also helps\nprotect against mortgage fraud by eliminating the potential for unexpected and/or\nunexplained costs charged by the bank or mortgage company at the actual\nclosing.\nPurpose for\nthe estimate Any licensee who represents a residential buyer and obtains a written purchase\noffer must prepare and provide an estimated closing statement to the buyer. The\nstatement must contain the most accurate and complete estimates of all costs that\nare the buyer's responsibility at the time the transaction closes. The statement\nmust itemize not only which costs the buyer will pay but also the estimated\namount of each cost. The licensee must provide the statement to the buyer at the\ntime the buyer signs the offer to purchase.\nAny licensee who represents a residential seller and presents a written purchase\noffer to such seller must also prepare and provide an estimated closing statement\nto the seller. The statement provided to the seller must show which costs are the\nseller's responsibilities and approximately how much each of those costs will be.\nThis statement is to be provided to the seller at the time the offer is presented.\nBy signing the estimated and the actual closing statements, both the buyer and the\nseller are acknowledging that they received the statements.\nTILA, RESPA and TRID. Alabama license law and administrative rules\nprotect the consumer by mandating that licensee provide an estimated closing\nChapter 27: Alabama Brokerage Regulation 471",

TILA-\nRESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) Rules have specific requirements for\ndisclosure notices from the lender of a mortgage loan to the borrower.\nUnder TRID, the Good Faith Estimate formerly provided by lenders has been\nreplaced by the Loan Estimate, which must be provided to the borrower of a\nmortgage loan within 3 business days of the borrower's application for the loan.\nAdditionally, a TRID-mandated Closing Disclosure must be provided to the\nborrower 3 days prior to closing on the mortgage loan.\nKeep in mind the difference in these mandated disclosures:\n\uf034 the estimated closing statement, mandated by Alabama law, is\nprovided by the real estate licensee to inform the buyer and the\nseller of all costs associated to the real estate transaction closing; it\nis provided at the time a purchase offer or counter offer is submitted\n\uf034 the loan estimate and closing disclosure, mandated by federal law,\nare provided by the lender to inform the borrower of the costs\nassociated with the mortgage loan; the loan estimate is provided at\nthe time the loan application is received, and the closing disclosure\nis three days prior to closing, as stated\nBoth federal and state laws work to assure the consumer is informed, prepared,\nand protected in real estate transactions and financing.\nEstimated closing\nexpenditures The estimated closing statement includes debits and credits for both the seller and\nthe buyer that are due at closing and the approximate amount of each.

If found guilty at a formal hearing, the licensee may have his or her\nlicense suspended or revoked, may have a $100 to $5,000 fine imposed, may be\nreprimanded for each instance of a guilty verdict.

They are prohibited from\nmaking false promises that could potentially influence, persuade, or induce a\nconsumer to enter into a contract. They are also prohibited from flagrant\nmisrepresentation in any form of advertising. Publishing any advertisement that\ndeceives the public or is likely to deceive the public is against the law. All\nadvertisements must identify the advertiser as a licensed broker or salesperson.\nAdvertising with an\ninterest Alabama license law exempts property owners from licensing requirements\nwhen the owners are managing their own property or engaging in a real estate\ntransaction involving their own property. In other words, a property owner can\nmanage, lease, or sell his or her own property without needing to be licensed as a\nreal estate salesperson or broker. This also means the property owner can\nadvertise his or her own property for lease or sale without needing to be licensed.\nAlabama license law also allows any property owner who becomes a licensed\nbroker or salesperson to advertise his or her own property. However, while the\nnon-licensed owner is exempt from the license laws, the licensed owner must\nabide by all provisions of the law and AREC rules in any real estate transaction.\nThis includes transactions in which the licensee is the property owner or the\nspouse, child, or parent of the property owner.\nThus, the licensee must also comply with all applicable laws when advertising his\nor her own property for lease or sale.\nFurther, if the licensee is advertising his or her own property or property\nbelonging to a member of the licensee's immediate family, the licensee must\nprovide prior written disclosure of his or her interest in the property to all parties\nto the transaction. The licensee must also disclose that he or she is a licensed real\nestate salesperson or broker. The law states the disclosure must be \"timely\"\nwithout giving a definitive time frame.\nIf the licensee is seeking to purchase an interest in a property being sold by his or\nher brokerage company, the licensee must disclose his or her intention to the\nproperty seller or the seller's agent. The licensee must inform the seller that he or\nshe is a licensed real estate salesperson or broker and that he or she is the\nintended buyer of the property.\nSignage Real estate licensees have the legal right to advertise property for sale, lease, or\ntransfer using signs that are affixed to or located on the property itself. Alabama\ndoes not allow a municipal corporation or local government to impose a fee or\ntax on the signs, whether the signs are located on or near the property.\nHowever, local, county and city governments are allowed to set and enforce\nreasonable restrictions on the size, height, and placement of signs on private\n474 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

While\nthe law has granted AREC the ability to adopt rules regarding the words that may\nand may not be used in team names and how teams may market and advertise\ntheir services, the law does proscribe a few of its own requirements.\nIn team advertisements, the name of at least one team member and the name of\nthe real estate company where the team members are licensed must both be\nincluded in the ad. Either \u201cteam\u201d or \u201cgroup\u201d must be included in the team name.\nIn addition, the qualifying broker must give written authorization to allow the\nteam to include its name in any advertisements.\nRECORDKEEPING\nBoth estimated closing statements and the actual closing statements must be\nretained in the broker's files. The buyer's agent should retain the estimated and\nactual closing statements signed by the buyer in his or her qualifying broker's\nfiles, while the seller's agent retains the statements signed by the seller. Neither\nlicensee is required to retain statements signed by both the buyer and the seller.\nNor is it necessary for cooperating brokers to maintain both the buyer's statement\nand the seller's statement.\nAlthough the law does not specify a time frame for retention of closing\nstatements, as with any documents or records related to a real estate transaction,\nthe statements should be retained for at least 3 years.\nChapter 27: Alabama Brokerage Regulation 475",

In Alabama, the laws that set forth the Real Estate Consumer's Agency and\nDisclosure Act are found in Articles 4 and 5, Section 34-27 and in Chapter 790-\nX-3 of the Alabama Real Estate License Law. The following definitions apply to\nthose laws and to agency relationships and disclosures.\nAgency agreement is a written brokerage agreement between a real estate\ncompany and a consumer that creates a fiduciary relationship between the\ncompany\u2019s qualifying broker and the consumer wherein the real estate company\nis hired to represent the consumer, who becomes a client and represents the\nclient's interest in a real estate transaction.\nBrokerage agreement is a specific written agreement between a real estate\ncompany and a consumer that establishes a brokerage relationship and contains\nthe terms and conditions of the services to be provided, including any\ncompensation to be paid to or through the company. The term encompasses both\nagency transaction facilitator agreements.\nBrokerage service is any service provided by a broker or licensee to another\nperson which includes activities for which a real estate license is required. Rental\nand property management are not included.\nBuyer\u2019s agreement is an agreement between a real estate company and a person\nwho is purchasing real estate in which the company agrees to assist that person\nwith the purchase in exchange for a fee as either a fiduciary or a non-fiduciary.\nConsumer is a person who obtains information, advice, or services from a real\nestate licensee regarding real estate and real estate transactions.\nChapter 28: Alabama Agency 481",

A client can be either a buyer or a seller.\nDual agency is an agency relationship in which a licensee represents both the\nseller and the buyer in the same transaction with the informed written consent of\nall parties, who have signed the consent agreement.\nFiduciary duties are those owed to a client when an agency agreement has been\nsigned. Fiduciary duties are those performed under obligation and trust and\ninclude loyalty and reasonable care.\nInformed consent is a consumer's agreement to allow something to happen based\non full disclosure of the facts needed to choose appropriate brokerage services.\nListing agreement is an agreement between a real estate company and a property\nowner who is selling real estate in which the company agrees to assist that party\nwith the sale in exchange for a fee as either a fiduciary or a non-fiduciary and\nalso applies to the seller\u2019s future decision to sell the property.\nMaterial fact is a fact that is of significance to a reasonable party which affects\nthe party's decision to enter into a real estate contract.\nSingle agent is a licensee who is engaged by and represents only one party in a\nreal estate transaction through a signed agency agreement. A single agent can be\na seller's agent or a buyer's agent. A single agent may be only a buyer\u2019s agent or a\nseller\u2019s agent in any single transaction.\nTransaction facilitator is a licensee who assists one or more parties in a\ntransaction without being an agent, fiduciary, or advocate for that party's interest\nin the transaction. Without a signed agreement in place, a transaction facilitator\nrelationship remains in effect.\nProtection to the\nconsumer Home buyers and sellers are often confused about the real estate salesperson or\nbroker's role in residential real estate transactions. They are also often unclear\nabout whom the salesperson or broker actually represents and what defines the\nboundaries of the agent-buyer-seller relationship.\nTo help clear up the confusion and protect consumers, the Alabama Legislature\nenacted the Real Estate Consumer Agency and Disclosure Act (RECAD) to set\nforth the roles and duties of real estate brokers.\nAlabama law requires that consumers be informed about the types of services that\nreal estate licensees may perform. Therefore, RECAD required the AREC to\nwrite a Real Estate Brokerage Services Disclosure form. All licensees must use\nthe form as a means of disclosure to consumers. While consumers are not\nrequired to sign the form, licensees should encourage them to do so as\nacknowledgement of having received the form.

The consumer may also choose which brokerage arrangement and services\nbest suits his or her needs. The consumer may choose any of the brokerage\narrangements available (to be discussed in detail later in this chapter) or may\nchoose not to enter into a brokerage or agency relationship at all. If the consumer\nchooses not to sign a brokerage arrangement, there is no agency relationship.\nA signed agency agreement must be in place before the licensee can perform\ncertain acts, such as making any offers for buyers or listing a property for sellers.\nA licensee may show properties to potential clients or host an open house without\nhaving an agency agreement in place.\nBased on the services offered by the company, the licensee may represent either\nthe buyer or the seller, or in some arrangements, both. Some companies focus\nonly on buyers while others focus only on sellers. Most companies represent both\nbuyers and sellers. Regardless of which the licensee represents, he or she will act\nfor or represent the client in negotiations with other parties.

The complete text of\nthis required form, which discusses single agency, dual agency, and transaction\nfacilitation, is found in Section 790-X-3-.13 of Alabama Real Estate License\nLaw. The broker must provide the disclosure form to the consumer before any\nconfidential information is exchanged and before the licensee provides any\nbrokerage services. The consumer then has the option of signing an agreement\nwith the broker or not and deciding what service arrangement will work best for\nhim or her. Consumers are not required to sign this form, but if the consumer\nrefuses, the licensee should make a note of the refusal on the form.\nOffer to purchase\nrequired language All offers to purchase must prominently contain a representation disclosure\nclause using prescribed language, which states the type of agency being\npracticed. This applies to both listing and selling licensees.\nAgency disclosure\noffice policy RECAD also requires all qualifying brokers to adopt and maintain an agency\ndisclosure office policy that sets the types of brokerage services his or her own\ncompany may offer or accept. Qualifying brokers are required to explain the\noffice policy to all licensees at least once a year. Licensees are required to sign a\nform acknowledging receipt of the company's policy statement and must also\nprovide the office policy disclosure to consumers so the consumer is fully\ninformed. This policy must include an explanation of how the real estate\ncompany and the brokers are compensated.\nRemember that Alabama licensees are only permitted to engage in services\noffered by the company and qualifying broker. Therefore, by setting an office\npolicy as to the services to be provided, the qualifying broker is assuring that the\nassociated licensees understand what services they may engage in and what\nservices they may not.

The law does not require the licensee to\nengage in any or all of the broker arrangements specified in the law, but the\nlicensee must inform the consumer that they exist.\nThe licensee is to use the Brokerage Services Disclosure form to explain the\navailable services to the consumer. As explained previously, use of the form is\nmandatory but the consumer's signature on the form is not required. Remember\nthat the disclosure must be provided at the initial contact with the consumer or as\nsoon as reasonably possible.\nCustomer or client The difference between a customer and a client is whether or not an agency\nagreement has been signed to obtain brokerage services.\nA customer is a person who is obtaining brokerage services from a licensee but\nhas not signed an agency agreement with the licensee or company. A client, on\nthe other hand, is a person who has signed an agency agreement with the licensee\nor company for specific brokerage services.\nThe licensee has obligations to both customers and clients. Many of the\nobligations are the same for both, but additional obligations are owed to a client.\nBrokerage\nrelationships RECAD allows a qualifying broker to offer services as a single agency, dual\nagency, and transaction facilitation. The qualifying broker is not required to offer\nall of these services, nor is he or she limited to offering only one of the services.\nTransaction facilitation. In this arrangement, the broker works with one or more\nparties in the same transaction without becoming an agent or fiduciary to any of\nthe parties. The transaction facilitator provides services to customers with or\nwithout a written agreement. The broker can act as an intermediary between the\nbuyer and the seller, providing neutral third-party services to both parties. The\ntransaction facilitator is not an agent and does not perform the same services as\nan agent. This is a non-agency relationship in which the broker's services are not\nfiduciary. This is also a relationship in which the broker has reduced liability.\nBuyers and sellers are customers and not clients because neither has signed an\nagency agreement with the broker. A seller would employ the broker to market\nhis or her property and show it to prospective buyers. The seller would also use\nthe broker's expertise in preparing the property for sale and determining an\nappropriate selling price. A buyer would use the broker to find and show suitable\nproperties that meet the buyer's needs and wishes. The buyer may also seek the\ntransaction broker's help in obtaining financing for the property and in finalizing\nthe sale and recording the deed.\nTransaction facilitation arrangements typically work best for consumers who\nneed marketing services and real estate expertise but who do not need an agent to\nhelp with price and terms negotiations.\nChapter 28: Alabama Agency 485",

Under\nAlabama law, the licensee is required to exercise reasonable care and skill,\nanswer all questions completely and accurately, and present all written offers\npromptly and truthfully. The licensee is also required to keep confidential\ninformation confidential unless disclosure is required under the law. To comply\nwith this requirement, transaction facilitators must completely and honestly\nanswer a buyer's questions about the condition of the property and must tell the\nbuyer about any hidden defects the broker knows about that could impact the\nhealth or safety of occupants.\nIf a qualifying broker offers transaction facilitator services by written agreement,\nthe agreement form must be included in the agency disclosure office policy.\nSingle agency. The single agent represents only one party in a transaction, and\nthat party is the agent's client. The client may be the seller or the buyer but not\nboth. A written agency agreement is required for the qualifying broker and/or the\nlicensee to become a single agent.\nA single agency brokerage arrangement works best for consumers who need\nadvice and help negotiating from a real estate professional. The consumer may\nalso need the licensee's marketing services. Buyers who are moving to a new area\nwhere they are unfamiliar with the local market conditions would benefit from a\nsingle agency agreement.\nIn this arrangement, the licensee is the client's agent and must represent only the\nclient in negotiations with other parties. The licensee must seek the best price and\nsale terms for his or her client. The agent is required to be completely loyal and\nfaithful to the client.\nDual agency. A licensee who is representing both the buyer and the seller is a\ndual agent. The agent may only represent both parties with their written,\ninformed consent. Dual agency is illegal in many states but is allowed in\nAlabama as long as the involved parties consent to the arrangement.\nDual agency is used when one licensee represents both the buyer and the seller in\nthe same transaction. The agent is required to be loyal and faithful to both clients\nexcept where the duties owed to the clients conflict.\nIn some states, if two or more salesperson under the same qualifying broker each\nrepresent a different party to the same transaction, it is a form of dual agency. In\nAlabama, however, both licensees are single agents. The qualifying broker and\nany other licensees involved in the transaction are assumed to not have any\nknowledge about the other party, even though the licensees are at the same real\nestate company.\nDual agency is common in larger real estate markets where companies have\nmany properties listed for sale, properties in which their own represented buyers\nmay be interested. With the dual agency agreement, agents representing sellers\ncan show properties to buyers they also represent.\nThe primary function of the licensee in a dual agency is to help both parties reach\nmutually satisfactory terms and price.

These rights\nare included in the law as the licensee's obligations to both customers and to\nclients.\nAdditionally, Alabama is one of ten states that have mandated the consumer's\nrights by requiring real estate brokers to provide buyers, sellers, landlords, and\ntenants a minimum level of services. This mandate includes helping the consumer\nnegotiate, presenting and receiving offers, and answering questions. The idea\nbehind this law is that real estate consumers need to be able to expect certain\nservices from a broker hired to represent them and that laws are necessary to\nguarantee a minimum level of service, thereby giving consumers legal rights\nwhen being represented in a real estate transaction.\nLicensee duties\nto customers If a consumer does not sign an agency agreement or brokerage service\nagreement, the consumer is a customer and not a client. However, the licensee\nstill has obligations to customers.\nOne of the first obligations is to provide the customer with a copy of the Real\nEstate Brokerage Services Disclosure form and the agency disclosure office\npolicy. The disclosure form outlines the types of representation that are available\nin Alabama, and the office policy describes the brokerage services provided at\nthat specific real estate company. Allow the customer to ask any questions he or\nshe has regarding the services. The agency disclosure office policy must also\noutline how the licensee and real estate company will be paid. The AREC\nrequires the licensee to sign, date, and provide the consumer with a copy of the\nBrokerage Service Disclosure form and the agency disclosure office policy. Both\nforms must be provided before the licensee lists a property or makes an offer on\nthe person\u2019s behalf.\nAlabama law also imposes the following obligations or duties on all real estate\nlicensees to all consumers, regardless of their relationship:\n\uf034 to provide services honestly and in good faith\n\uf034 to exercise reasonable care and skill in providing services\n\uf034 to keep confidential any information obtained in confidence or any\ninformation the licensee knows should be kept confidential, unless\ndisclosure is required by the law or by the duty to a client, unless\nChapter 28: Alabama Agency 487",

Typically, the misrepresentation would be on the seller's part to\npersuade the buyer to actually purchase the property. Misrepresentation\ngenerally applies only to statements of fact and not to opinions or predictions. It\ncan also occur through omission or failure to disclose material facts.\nBecause there is a duty to correct any false statements or omissions, failure to\nmake the correction is also considered misrepresentation, or, more specifically,\nnegligent misrepresentation.\nMisrepresentation is the lawsuit that brokers face the most. The second lawsuit\nbrokers face most often is the failure to disclose. Misrepresentation can be\nclassified as innocent, negligent, and fraudulent. Negligent misrepresentation\nincludes not disclosing significant property defects out of ignorance. Fraudulent\nmisrepresentation is purposefully hiding a property defect just to make the sale.\nConsequently, honest and timely disclosures are the best way to avoid being\nguilty of misrepresentation.

    "text": "Caveat emptor and property disclosures. Caveat emptor is a Latin term\nmeaning \"let the buyer beware.\" This phrase also implies that the seller has no\nactual duty to disclose issues with the property's physical condition to the buyer \u2013\nall of that is up to the buyer. The burden of examining the property before\npurchase falls on the buyer and, the responsibility for the property's condition is\nplaced on the buyer.\nMany states do not employ the rule of caveat emptor. Rather, they require sellers\nto formally disclose issues with the property, usually with an approved disclosure\nform. Alabama, however, is not one of those states. It uses the rule of caveat\nemptor for the sale of used residential property. There are exceptions to the rule\nin Alabama:\n\uf034 if a fiduciary relationship exists between the buyer and the seller,\nmeaning there is a legal responsibility to act in the best interest of\nthe other party, such as the seller's doctor is the buyer\n\uf034 if the seller knows the property may pose a health or safety risk to\nthe buyer, meaning if the seller knows the home has lead paint or\nasbestos\n\uf034 if the buyer asks direct questions to the seller on specific defects,\nmeaning if the buyer asks about a defect such as pest infestations\nIn any of these exceptions, the seller must disclose those defects of which he or\nshe is familiar. If the seller fails to disclose the known material defects to the\nbuyer, the seller may be liable for damages. The buyer who later discovers the\ndefect would be able to sue the seller for misrepresentation.\nHowever, under Alabama's caveat emptor law, the failure to disclose a known\ndefect may not be sufficient grounds on which to hold the seller liable. The buyer\nwould need to prove that the seller knew that the specific defect posed a direct\nthreat to the buyer's health or safety. For example, the buyer would have to prove\nthat the seller knew the buyer was allergic to a particular product or substance\ncontained in the home. That's fairly difficult to prove in most cases.\nNotice above that Alabama uses the rule in the sale of used residential property.\nBecause new homes have an implied warranty of habitability by the builder, the\nrule of caveat emptor is not applied to new homes. However, for the home to\nmeet the requirements of the implied warranty in a liability case, the buyer must\nshow six things:\n1. the buyer purchased a new home from the seller\n2. the seller built the home\n3. the home was not inhabited by any other person before the buyer's\npurchase\n4. the home was built by the seller for the purpose of sale and was\nsold to the buyer in a defective condition which impaired the\nhome's intended use\n490 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The seller's agent should also insist the defects be\ndisclosed to avoid being held liable for misrepresentation.\nPossibly the best way to disclose the defects and avoid misrepresentation is to\nhave the seller complete a property disclosure form and give it to the buyer prior\nto closing. Most Alabama agents provide the form to the seller for completion at\nthe time the seller lists the property with the agent. The agent can then provide a\ncopy of the completed form to the potential buyer. Alabama sellers are not\nrequired to complete or provide the disclosure form but doing so is the best way\nof making all disclosures that are legally required.\nMisrepresentation and broker liability. Alabama law holds that a client is not\nliable for misrepresentation which is made by the broker while providing\nbrokerage services to the client unless the client knows or should have known\nabout the misrepresentation. The client can be held liable for a misrepresentation\nmade by the broker if the broker is repeating a misrepresentation made by the\nclient to the broker. For example, a client knows his property contains asbestos\nbut lies about that to the agent. Then, if the agent fails to disclose the asbestos to\nthe buyer because the agent is repeating the client's misrepresentation, the client\ncan be held liable for that misrepresentation.\nAlabama law also holds that a licensee is not liable for providing false\ninformation if the information was provided by the client, a customer, or another\nlicensee. If the licensee knows or should have known the information was false,\nthen he or she can be held liable.\nEven with the rule of caveat emptor, there are times when a real estate broker can\nand will be held liable for misrepresentation. Purchasers who discover physical\ndefects in the property after the transaction has closed may want to recover their\nlosses from the real estate broker who handled the transaction. Honest and\nthorough disclosure is the best way to avoid these situations.\nLISTINGS\nRequired listing services. Alabama license law mandates specific requirements to\nbe met by a listing agent when working with a property seller and the seller's\nagent. The law states the following:\n\"When accepting an agreement to list an owner\u2019s property for sale,\nthe broker or his or her licensee shall, at a minimum, accept\ndelivery of and present to the consumer all offers, counteroffers,\nand addenda to assist the consumer in negotiating offers,\nChapter 28: Alabama Agency 491",

The seller may negotiate\nlisting agreements that meet his or her individual needs, knowledge, and\nexperience. The seller may choose to receive any offers directly from a selling\nagent and may have his or her contact information made available for this\npurpose. In making this choice, the seller is relieving the listing agent of the duty\nto prepare and provide an estimated closing statement, which is required when an\noffer on a single-family residential property comes through the listing agent. The\nselling agent, however, is still required to provide an estimated closing statement\nto the potential buyer. The selling agent is not required to provide the estimated\nclosing statement to the seller since the selling agent is only transmitting the offer\nand not presenting it to the seller. The selling agent is also not required to answer\nthe seller's questions; that is the responsibility of the listing agent.\nSellers may also choose to control the use of their property when it comes to\nsignage. The seller may allow the listing agent to provide and post signage on the\nlisted property, or the seller may choose to use his or her own signage. The seller\ncan choose to have both the agent's sign and the seller's sign on the property or no\nsigns at all.\nIn any listing where the seller is exercising his or her rights to negotiate\nbrokerage services and arrangements, the licensee should consult with the\nqualifying broker to ensure that office policies are being followed.\n492 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

In such a suit, the buyer may be granted a final\nmoney judgment to cover any damages the buyer suffered due to the lack of\ndisclosure.

A\nviolation would also occur with failing to disclose material facts regarding the\nproperty or transaction.\nFailure to report\nlegal action\ndisposition If a licensee has action taken against him or her in a criminal or civil matter\ninvolving a real estate transaction, the licensee must notify the Commission\nwithin 10 days after receiving notice of the action.

Under Alabama license law, the first obligation that licensees have to all\nconsumers is to provide services honestly and in good faith.\nAny of the following acts which defy the obligation of honesty and good faith is\na violation of the law.\nDishonesty in\nprocuring license The license law stipulates requirements for obtaining a real estate license. If a\nlicensee or applicant uses fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit or makes a material\nmisstatement of fact to obtain or attempt to obtain a license, he or she has\nviolated the law. Such is the case whether the license is for him or herself or for\nanother person.\nThis offense would include such actions as cheating on the licensure\nexamination, making false statements on the application, using the licensee's\nname to obtain a license for someone else, and so on.\nDishonesty in\npersonal real\nestate transactions Licensees are required to be honest and forthright when selling, buying, trading,\nor renting real property belonging to the licensee or to his or her spouse, child, or\nparent. If the licensee is dishonest or commits fraud or misrepresentation in this\nsituation, he or she has violated the law.\nLet's say that licensee Lenny is representing a buyer who is interested in a home\nthat Lenny just happens to own. However, Lenny doesn't disclose his ownership\nof the home. Lenny also does not disclose that the home was flooded a year ago,\nresulting in the occurrence of black mold in the basement that was not\nprofessionally removed. When the buyer makes an offer on the home, Lenny tells\nthe buyer that the owner has multiple offers and encourages the buyer to\ndrastically increase his offer price.\nLenny has violated the law by failing to disclose his interest in the property, by\nfailing to disclose material facts about the property that will put the buyer's health\n498 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The licensee must know\nabout the defect(s), and the defects must not be trivial or insignificant. The\ndefects must qualify as significant factors in the buyer deciding whether or not to\npurchase or lease the property.\nIf we look again at licensee Lenny who is selling his own home and not\ndisclosing his ownership interest or the previous mold issue, we might also\ndiscover that the home has structural issues from the flooding and length of time\nthe flood water sat in the home. Of course, Lenny doesn't disclose this structural\nissue either. Consequently, Lenny has committed yet another violation of the law\nby not disclosing a latent structural defect that, if the buyer knew about, could\npotentially cause the buyer to walk away from the purchase.\nFalse promises to\ninfluence or\ninduce Considering that the law requires licensees to be honest in real estate\ntransactions, making false promises to influence, persuade, or induce a person to\nsign a contract or agreement is dishonest and a violation of the law.\nFor example, Lenny's home is next door to a rather run down home with an\nunkempt yard, and the buyer is reluctant to purchase based on the neighboring\nproperty. Lenny is untruthful in telling the buyer that the neighboring property\nhas just been purchased and the new owners will be renovating the home and\ncleaning up the yard. Lenny promises the buyer that the house next door will be\nbeautiful within a few months. Reality is that the current neighbors have no\nintention of selling the home or cleaning up the property.\nFurthermore, to influence the buyer to sign the purchase agreement, Lenny\npromises the buyer that once the neighbor's property is cleaned up and renovated,\nthe value of the home Lenny is selling will increase by at least 25%, resulting in\nthe buyer ending up with considerable equity in the home. If the buyer should\nresell the home, he or she would obtain a much higher asking price than what the\nbuyer will pay.\nLenny has made multiple false promises to influence the buyer to sign a purchase\nagreement. Lenny has violated the law.\nMisrepresentation\nthrough other\nagents Just as licensees are not allowed to make false promises to influence a person to\nsign a contract, the licensee is also not allowed to continue the false promises or\nmisrepresentations through other agents or salespersons. The licensee also may\nnot continue the deception through any form of advertising.\nOnce again using Lenny as an example, if he uses another agent to further\ninfluence the buyer to purchase the home based on Lenny's false promises and\nmisrepresentation, Lenny has violated this particular section of the law.

    "text": "advertises the home for sale with any of these misrepresentations or false\npromises, that is also a violation of this law.\nDeceitful\nadvertising Actually, the law specifically prohibits deceptive advertising. Licensees must not\npublish or cause to be published any advertisement that deceives the public, even\nif it is only likely to deceive. Advertisements must not create a misleading\nimpression.\nFor example, let's say a licensee publishes the following advertisement:\nBeautiful 4-bedroom home in up and coming neighborhood with child-\nfriendly park and waterfront homes. For more details, call Harold\nConnor at 555-8382.\nIn reality, the home has 3 bedrooms and a garage that is enclosed and is currently\nbeing used as a fourth bedroom although it does not contain any closets. The\n\"child-friendly\" park is really a vacant lot at the end of the street, and the\n\"waterfront\" homes sit adjacent to a fenced retention pond.\nThe ad for this home is deceptive and certainly gives a misleading impression of\nthe home. Consequently, the ad and the licensee are in violation of the law.\nInducing a party\nto breach a contract Typically, parties to a transaction sign a contract with terms to which all of the\nparties have agreed. Neither party may breach the contract without consequences.\nAt the same time, the licensee must not convince either party to breach the\ncontract and substitute a new one that will benefit the licensee more than the\noriginal contract.\nLicensee Linda represents a seller who has already signed a purchase agreement\nwith a buyer. The contract states the amount of the purchase price at $250,000.\nBoth seller and buyer have agreed to that price. However, Linda knows that a\nhigher purchase price will bring her a higher commission payment. If Linda\nconvinces the seller to breach the contract and substitute a new contract with an\nincreased selling price, Linda has violated this law.\nAnother example would be if Licensee Linda changes qualifying brokers and\ntries to take this client's listing with her to the new brokerage firm. The listing\nagreement is with the original firm and cannot be moved to the new firm unless\nthe client breaches the contract with the original brokerage firm. If Linda\nconvinces the client to cancel the original contract and sign another one at the\nnew firm, she is violating this law.\nDishonest dealings,\nbad faith,\nuntrustworthiness Remember that Alabama real estate laws and rules emphasize honesty and good\nfaith. Trustworthiness is not just a good quality, it is a requirement. Therefore,\nanything that a real estate professional does that constitutes dishonest dealings,\nbad faith, or untrustworthiness is a violation of the Alabama License Law.\nMany examples can be cited: if a client tells his or her agent something in\nconfidence, trusting the agent to keep the confidence, the agent must exercise\ntrustworthiness by keeping the confidence. If the licensee receives offers to\npurchase a client's property, the agent must exercise good faith by delivering the\n500 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Licensees must continually\ndemonstrate that they can be trusted. If they fail to demonstrate that or fail to be\nhonest and trustworthy, they have violated the law that requires this of them.\nUnlicensed person\nacting on behalf of\nlicensee The law is specific on what acts require a real estate salesperson or broker\nlicense. Remember that the law requires a real estate license for anyone who\nsells, buys, leases, rents, exchanges real property or negotiates to sell, buy, lease,\nrent, or exchange real property for another person for compensation. An\nunlicensed person who performs any of those acts for compensation is breaking\nthe law.\nThe law also stipulates that, if anyone helps, employs, or establishes an\nassociation with an unlicensed person and expects or requires the unlicensed\nperson to perform any of those acts, that individual is also breaking the law.\nSo, if a qualifying broker hires an unlicensed individual for the purpose of listing\nand showing properties, the qualifying broker is violating this law.\nFurthermore, an individual is also prohibited from aiding, abetting, or conspiring\nwith a person to circumvent the licensing requirements outlined in the license\nlaws.\nFor example, Joe wants to work as a real estate broker, but he does not have a\nlicense. Joe doesn't meet the qualifications for licensure because he never\ngraduated from high school or obtained a GED. Sarah falsifies a high school\ndiploma and graduation records for Joe so he can qualify for licensure. Not only\nhas Joe violated the law, but so has Sarah.\nFailure to disclose\nintention to\npurchase If a licensee is interested in purchasing the property his or her seller client is\nselling, the licensee must disclose the interest to the client. If the agent selling the\nproperty is the licensee's associate, the licensee still must disclose his or her\ninterest in purchasing the property. Whether the licensee plans to buy the\nproperty directly or indirectly, the licensee still must disclose his or her interest.\nThis mandate is similar to the one that requires a licensee to disclose his or her\nown interest in a property the licensee is selling. Both situations require the\nlicensee to let the client know about the licensee's interest in the property.\nIf Tami has a client who is selling a home that Tami would like to buy, Tami\nmust tell the client that she will be the purchaser. However, let's say that Tami\nwants to buy the home but doesn't want to disclose that to the seller. So, Tami\ndecides to have her father purchase the home and then transfer the title over to\nTami. In this way, Tami would be purchasing the home indirectly, but, under\nAlabama law, she would still be required to disclose this to the seller. Failure to\ndo so is a violation of the law.\nFailure to disclose\nthe true terms of\na contract Licensees must disclose the true terms of a real estate sale to any lender,\nguaranteeing agency, or any other interested party.

If\nthe value of a property is misrepresented to the lender at $250,000 when the\nvalue is really $200,000, the loan to value ratio will be incorrect. The lender will\nmost likely set up a mortgage loan at a higher amount than the property supports.\nThe licensee who misrepresented the property's true value will have violated this\nparticular law.\nKeeping in mind many of the other mandates of the law, the licensee will also\nhave violated mandated honesty, trustworthiness, and good faith.\nActing negligently\nor incompetently To qualify for a license, Alabama law requires a person to be trustworthy and\ncompetent to practice real estate. The law also sets forth the acts for which an\nindividual must possess a real estate license. The law further mandates that an\nindividual must not act negligently or incompetently in performing any of those\nacts which require a license.\nSo, let's use Jim as an example. Jim holds a real estate broker license and is in the\nprocess of handling a transaction for a client purchasing a home. Jim knows he\nhas certain obligations to the client, such as looking out for the client's best\ninterest and negotiating the best purchase price for the home. However, Jim has\nbeen rather distracted lately and has not been fulfilling his obligations. Jim\nneglected to suggest his client have the home inspected. He also neglected to\npoint out to the client that the home is in a deed restricted community. Further,\nJim didn't appear to know how to negotiate the best price. When the seller\ncounter offered at a higher price, Jim recommended that his client offer an even\nhigher price than the counteroffer, just to\" seal the deal.\"\nThe buyer was confused by Jim's recommendation but figured Jim, as a\nprofessional, knew what he was doing. Unfortunately, the client was wrong. Jim\nwas negligent and acting incompetently during most of the transaction, costing\nthe client thousands of dollars.

Let's take a\nlook at what Julie did with the money.\nJulie received the earnest money in cash on Monday. She decided to hang onto\nthe money for a while to see if the sale would actually go through. Although she\nmentioned receiving the money to her qualifying broker, she did not turn the\nfunds over to him. Julie's qualifying broker knew she had the earnest money but\nhad no idea the amount of the funds.

However, Julie\nhad violated the law by not accounting for the funds and by not turning the funds\nover to her qualifying broker for deposit,\nCommingling The law also makes it clear that commingling, or mixing others' money with the\nlicensee's personal or business funds is not allowed.\nSo, if we go back to the case of Julie and the earnest money she received, let's see\nwhat she actually did with the money while she was hanging onto it.\nAfter Julie received the cash and mentioned it to her qualifying broker, she\ndecided she wouldn't have the funds deposited into the company's trust account\nso she could readily access the money if necessary. Instead, she decided she\nChapter 29: Alabama License Law Violations 503",

The law states any funds belonging to others must be turned\nover to the qualifying broker and must be deposited into a trust account.

Julie violated that law.\nFailure to keep\nfunds in separate,\nfederally insured\naccount Federally insured accounts protect any funds deposited into the account. Deposits\nare insured for $250,000. Because of this security, Alabama license law requires\nlicensees to have any money belonging to others deposited into a separate\nfederally insured account in a financial institution located in Alabama.\nBack to Julie: Most likely her personal checking account was at a federally\ninsured bank, so the funds were secure once they were deposited. However, we\nalready know she broke the law by depositing the cash into her own account and\nnot recording or accounting for the funds at all.

Additionally, Julie hung onto the cash for 3 weeks before she deposited\nit.\nDuring the 3 weeks she was hanging onto the cash, Julie was committing another\nviolation by not having the funds secured in a federally insured account. Once\nJulie deposited the funds into her own account, she was still violating this\nparticular mandate because, not only were the funds commingled with Julie's\npersonal funds, but the money was deposited in a bank located outside of\nAlabama.\nFailure to keep\nrecords for 3 years According to license law, if a document is touched or created by a licensee\nduring any real estate activities, the qualifying broker must be given a copy of the\ndocument to be kept in his or her files. Documents which must be kept include all\ncontracts, leases, listings, and other records, including a complete record of all\nfunds that belong to others, showing to whom the money belongs, the date any\nmonies were deposited and/or withdrawn, and any other pertinent information.\nAll documents and records must be kept for at least 3 years. Failing to do so is a\nviolation of the law.\nThis mandate could be broken in multiple ways: first, the licensee could fail to\ngive copies of documents to the qualifying broker as required by law. Second, the\nqualifying broker could fail to keep the records for at least 3 years as required.\nOne more way a violation could occur is if the records of funds belonging to\nothers do not include names and dates as required.\n504 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Paying commission\nto unlicensed\nperson Because the law requires anyone performing specific acts in a real estate\ntransaction to be licensed if the individual is compensated for the acts, then an\nunlicensed person may not be paid any profit, compensation, commission, or fee\nfor performing such acts. These acts include but are not limited to selling, buying,\nleasing, renting, and exchanging real property or negotiating to sell, buy, lease,\nrent, or exchange real property.\nHowever, the law specifically does not prohibit a licensee from owning a\nbusiness organization whose purpose is to receive payments of profits,\ncompensation, commissions, or fees. In this case, the business does not need to\nhold a real estate license as long as it does not engage in any other activity that\nrequires a license.\nSo, let's say that Jerrod is a licensed real estate broker. His friend Frank helps him\nfrom time to time in certain real estate transactions. Frank is not licensed, so\nJerrod is careful about what he allows Frank to do. However, Jerrod is not as\ncareful as he should be. He allows Frank to show property and, in return, pays\nFrank a percentage of any commission received when the property sells.\nJerrod has violated two laws: he is allowing an unlicensed person to perform acts\nthat require a license, and he is compensating an unlicensed person for\nperforming acts that require a license.\nNow let's say that Jerrod owns a business that collects any funds owed in relation\nto real estate transactions. The business collects commissions, profits, and other\ncompensation and fees. That is all they do. However, the business is not licensed\nunder Alabama real estate license laws. Has Jerrod violated another law?\nNo, Jerrod has not violated another law. Jerrod is allowed to own such an\nunlicensed business as long as the business does not perform any acts that require\na real estate license.\nUndisclosed or\npost-closing rebates Alabama law prohibits paying or receiving a rebate from any person in a real\nestate transaction after the transaction has closed. By Commission definition, a\nrebate is any unearned fee, kickback, or thing of value that is given in connection\nwith a real estate transaction. Further, the definition of a rebate implies it is\nsomething given back after a transaction has occurred.\nGiving any rebate or incentive legally depends mostly on how and when it is\ngiven. In Alabama, the incentive must be given before or at closing and must be\ndisclosed to all parties involved in the transaction, to include the seller, buyer,\nand lender or guaranteeing agency (FHA, VA, HUD). A rebate or other incentive\nthat is given after or outside of the closing and is related to the transaction\nviolates the law. Since rebates given before or during closing must be disclosed,\nan undisclosed rebate related to the transaction also violates the law.\nIf the incentive is not disclosed to the lender, etc., the law that prohibits\nmisrepresentation or failure to disclose the true terms of a sale to the lender,\nguaranteeing agency, or other interested parties will have been violated. In that\nChapter 29: Alabama License Law Violations 505",

The law does allow licensees to pay the following\nincentives:\n\uf034 cash to a property owner who lists his or her property with the\nlicensee to sell.\n\uf034 cash to a customer to influence him or her to purchase a property\n\uf034 an item, such as a car or refrigerator, to a customer to influence him\nor her to purchase a property\n\uf034 1 month's free rent to a customer to influence him or her to rent an\napartment\n\uf034 repair expenses to influence a buyer and seller to sign a contract or\nclose a sale\nAn example of an illegal incentive would be something like this: if a buyer does\nnot qualify for a mortgage loan for a particular property, the licensee might give\nthe buyer a loan or gift that would allow the buyer to qualify for the loan. If that\nloan or gift is not disclosed, not only has the licensee violated the law, but he or\nshe may also have criminal charges brought against him or her.\nLottery inducements Offering free lots or conducting lotteries to influence a party to purchase or lease\nreal estate is a violation of the license law. This practice also violates other laws.\nIf a licensee offers free lots as incentive to purchase or lease real estate, the\nlicensee must disclose the gift and its value, just as with rebates. Further, the\ntransfer of ownership of the lots would need to take place prior to or at closing of\nthe purchase or lease transaction, or the licensee has violated the law prohibiting\nrebates.\nIn regard to offering lotteries, Alabama has criminal statutes prohibiting lotteries\nof any kind. Therefore, licensees offering lotteries as incentives to purchase or\nlease real estate would be violating these statutes and would most likely be\nbrought up on criminal charges.\nAccepting\ncommission from\nanyone other than\nqualifying broker Salespersons and associate brokers may accept commission payments or any\nother compensation only from their qualifying broker. Therefore, if a salesperson\nor associate broker engages in activities that require a license and then accepts\nany form of compensation directly from a seller, a company, or anyone else other\nthan the qualifying broker, that salesperson or associate broker has violated the\nlaw.\nFor example, Betsy is Tim's agent handling the sale of his family home. Betsy\nhas done a great job of showing the home and finding just the right buyer. So,\nTim is grateful to Betsy for making the experience pleasant. Therefore, Tim pays\nBetsy the agreed-upon commission when the sale closes. Betsy thanks Tim and\ndeposits the commission into her personal bank account.\n506 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

She should have had the commission paid to her\nqualifying broker and then accepted payment from him or her.\nFailure to provide\nestimated\nclosing costs Licensees are required to prepare and present estimated closing statements to\nboth the seller and the buyer in a real estate transaction. The estimated closing\nstatement must be presented to the buyer when an offer is written and to the seller\nwhen an offer is received. The estimated closing statement shows what costs are\ninvolved in the transaction and the approximate amount of those costs.\nTerry has a client looking to purchase a home. Terry has found just the right\nhome for the buyer, and together, Terry and his client have written an offer. Terry\nknows he's supposed to show his client an estimated closing statement when they\npresent the offer, but he decides to wait to see if the seller accepts the offer. After\nall, the seller may counter offer, causing some of the numbers on the estimated\nclosing statement to change.\nWhile Terry's decision to wait may seem like a good idea, it is a violation of\nAlabama license law that states the buyer must be informed of closing costs and\nthe approximate amount of those costs at the time the offer is written, not at the\ntime the offer is accepted.\nFailure to submit\nrecords From time to time, the AREC may request a licensee or qualifying broker to\nproduce documents, books, or other records related to a real estate transaction for\nthe Commission's inspection or the inspection of their authorized representative.\nThe law mandates that these records must be produced on demand and that\nfailing to refusing to do so is a violation of the law.\nJason received a request from the AREC to produce any records and documents\nrelated to a real estate transaction involving Cara and Sam Connor. As the\ncompany's qualifying broker, Jason is in possession of all transaction-related\nrecords. While putting the records together to turn over to the AREC, Jason\nnotices a problem with the estimated closing statement one of his associate\nbrokers produced. Not wanting the Commission to see the problem, Jason does\nnot include the document with the other records he will turn over to the\nCommission.\nJason believes he is protecting his associate broker and his real estate firm by not\nrevealing the problem document. What Jason is doing is breaking the law and\ncompounding the problem. Having a document with an error that was not\ndiscovered and corrected is a problem, but refusing to produce that document for\nthe AREC is a bigger problem.\nFailure to provide\nAREC-requested\ninformation Just as licensees and qualifying brokers are required to produce documents and\nrecords upon the demand of the AREC, they are also required to provide any\ninformation the Commission requests as part of an investigation or a complaint.\nThe law allows a \"reasonable time\" in which to provide the information. Failing\nto provide the information is a violation of the law.\nLet's go back to Jason and the request the AREC made of him to produce certain\nrecords. In addition to the records, the Commission requested information about\nChapter 29: Alabama License Law Violations 507",

In the end, 3\nmonths passed with Jason still not providing the information to the Commission.\nBy definition, reasonable time is the amount of time that is fairly necessary to do\nwhat is requested or required as soon as circumstances permit. Although the\nlicense law provides a reasonable time and not a specific time period for the\nbroker to produce the information, the AREC most likely will not consider 3\nmonths with still no information provided as reasonable. Jason is violating the\nlaw by not providing the information within a reasonable time and certainly by\nnot providing it at all.\nFailure to return\nrecords During a real estate transaction, the licensee may find it necessary to obtain\ncertain documents or records from a client or other party to the transaction. If the\nparty provides the document and later wants the document returned, the licensee\nmust return the document to its rightful owner. Failure to do so is a violation of\nthe law unless the licensee has a legal cause for not returning the document.\nDuring a transaction to purchase a home in a deed restricted community, Sue was\nasked to give her agent a copy of her dog's shot records and license registration.\nSue complied because she understood the community's rule that all pets must be\nkept up to date on their shots and licensing. Once the transaction closed and Sue\nwas moving into the new home, she told her agent she wanted her dog's records\nreturned to her. Her agent, however, stated he wanted to keep the records in his\nfile on the entire transaction and would not return them to Sue.\nNot having legal cause to keep the dog's records, Sue's agent violated the law by\nnot returning the records to their rightful owner.\nFailure to report\naddress change When a licensee is issued a license certificate, the certificate includes the address\nof his place of business. If the licensee changes that address, he or she must\nnotify the Commission in writing within 30 days after the address changes. The\nlicensee needs to include both the company's old address and the new address in\nthe written notification. To change the business address, the qualifying broker\nmust return the company license and all broker and salesperson licenses to the\nCommission with a transfer fee for each license. Failure to notify the AREC\nwithin the 30 days, to include the required information, and/or to return the\ncompany and other licenses violates the administrative rules of the AREC.\nFor example, Kelly owns a real estate firm on Main Street with 3 associate\nbrokers and 4 salespersons. Kelly is the qualifying broker for the firm. Kelly\nrecently found a new location over on Elm Street and has moved the entire office\noperations to the new location. She's been so busy with the move and getting all\nof her salespersons and brokers settled that she has not notified the Commission\nof her new address, nor has she returned all of the current licenses as required. It's\nbeen 3 weeks since she moved, so Kelly still has time to notify the Commission\n508 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

When licensees\ndo not fulfill those obligations, they are in violation of Alabama license law and\nthe AREC Administrative Rules.\nUnauthorized\ndual agency Licensees may enter into a few types of agency with consumers. One of those is\ndual agency. The most important aspect of this relationship is that all parties to\nthe relationship must consent to their agent representing more than one party in\nthe same transaction. When the parties consent to this arrangement, they must do\nso in writing. If the licensee does not obtain the authorization of all parties, the\nlicensee has violated the law.\nLet's say that licensee Scott is in a position to represent both seller Raymond and\nbuyer Denise in the sale of Raymond's home and five acres of land. Both\nRaymond and Denise want Scott to represent them, but they are not familiar with\ndual agency relationships. Raymond is trying to figure out how to have Scott\nrepresent just him and let Denise find her own agent. The situation is becoming\ntense.\nScott explains to Raymond that he can legally represent both him and Denise in\nthe transaction under the dual agency relationship. Raymond agrees to the\narrangement, and the transaction progresses. There is just one problem: Scott\nnever informed Denise or obtained her authorization for the dual agency\nrelationship. Because the law states that Scott must obtain written consent from\nall parties he is representing, getting only Raymond's consent was not enough.\nScott has violated the law.\nFailure to provide\ndocument copies When a party is involved in a real estate transaction, that party has the right to\nreceive copies of each document related to the transaction. It is the licensee's\nobligation to furnish the copies, so failure to do so violates the law.\nGeorge is selling his property and has signed an agency agreement with Eddie, a\nbroker representing Home Hunters Realtors. Eddie and George have set forth the\nterms of the agreement and the listing for the property. After Eddie has shown the\nproperty several times without receiving any offers, George wants to take another\nlook at the agreement and listing contract.

Not only has Eddie lied to his client, but he has broken the law that\nsays he must voluntarily furnish a copy of each listing, contract, lease, and other\ndocument to each party executing the document. He must do so with reasonable\npromptness.\nAdvertising without\nprominently\ndisplaying\nbrokerage name Advertising real estate in Alabama brings with it certain requirements under the\nlaw. One requirement is that the advertiser must identify him or herself as a\nlicensed real estate salesperson or broker. Another requirement is that the\nsalesperson or broker must include the name or trade name of the qualifying\nbroker or company prominently on all advertising. Likewise, the qualifying\nbroker must not allow the salesperson or broker to advertise without including the\nname or trade name of the company or qualifying broker prominently on all\nadvertising.\n\u201cProminently\u201d means the information must be printed in a larger font than is used\nelsewhere in the ad for terms such as \u201cfor sale\u201d or \u201cfor lease,\u201d and the\ninformation must be placed where it will get the attention of consumers who are\nlooking at the ad.\nTania puts together the following ad for a property she is contracted to sell:\nNewly remodeled 3-bedroom condominium for sale. Small\nhomeowner association fee and nice amenities, including an indoor\npool and gym. Covered parking with security. Contact Tania Riley,\na licensed real estate broker, at 555-8855 for details.\nTania knows she must identify herself as a licensed broker within the ad, and she\nshows the ad to her qualifying broker to assure she has done everything\naccording to the law. Her qualifying broker agrees that everything looks good\nand approves the ad for placement in the local newspaper and online.\nOnce the ad is placed, both Tania and her qualifying broker will have violated the\nlaw requiring the name or trade name of the company and qualifying broker to be\nincluded in all advertising. By allowing the ad to be placed without the company\nname showing prominently, the qualifying broker has also violated the law.\nPlacing a sign on\nproperty without\nowner's consent When a licensee signs a listing agreement with a client, one of the first things the\nagent will want to do is advertise the property for sale. Placing a sign on the\nproperty is one effective advertising technique. However, according to the law,\nthe licensee must obtain the client's consent before placing any signs on the\nproperty. Failure to do so violates the law.\nLee has just signed a listing agreement with Terrance, so Lee is anxious to get the\nproperty advertised and sold. While Lee is touring the home and taking\nphotographs, he places a for sale sign in the front yard.

So, Lee has violated the law\nthat says he must obtain the consent of the property owner before placing a for\nsale sign on the property.\nTaking a net listing A net listing is one that stipulates a net price the owner must receive for the sale\nof the property with any amount received over that net price going to the broker\nas his or her commission. The commission is not based on a percent of the sale\nprice but is actually the amount in excess of the owner's required net price. Net\nlistings are not permitted in many states, including Alabama. Therefore, any\nlicensee accepting a net listing agreement for the sale of real property or any\ninterest in the property is in violation of the law.\nFor example, Caroline has a new client who wants to sell his home. The client\nwants $350,000 for the home, not a penny more or less. Caroline thinks the home\nis worth considerably more than $350,000, so she suggests they set up the\ncommission to be paid as any amount for which she can sell the home in excess\nof the $350,000. As long as the client gets his $350,000, he doesn't care how\nmuch she gets for the house, so he agrees to let Caroline's commission be\nwhatever amount over $350,000 she receives for the house. Both the client and\nCaroline are happy with the arrangement.\nHowever, what Caroline has done is set up a net listing. In doing so, she has\nviolated the law that prohibits net listings in Alabama.\nOmission of\nexpiration date on\nlisting\nThe listing agreement creates an agency and fiduciary relationship between the\nseller and the licensee. Most states require the listing agreement to be in writing\nand to include an expiration date. The AREC Administrative Rules do not allow\nautomatic extensions of a listing agreement, so the expiration date must be\nincluded. Failing to include a fixed expiration date in the listing agreement is a\nviolation. Further, the law requires a copy of the listing agreement to be given to\nthe principal (seller).\nBrian signed a listing agreement with Sheri. Brian included an expiration date for\nthe agreement but told Sheri that the date was flexible. In case the property was\nnot sold by the stated expiration date, they would just set up an automatic\nextension of the expiration date so the listing agreement would remain in effect\nuntil the property was actually sold. That sounded okay to Sheri until she learned\nthat setting a flexible expiration date and/or automatically extending the\nexpiration date was against Alabama law. Sheri then declined to sign the listing\nagreement and found another broker who did not violate the law or rules.\nFailure to present\nall offers When a licensee signs a listing agreement with a seller, one of the main\nobligations the licensee has to the seller client is to present all written purchase\noffers to the client. Failure to do so is a violation.\nIra has a listing agreement with Frank to sell Frank's farm. Ira has received only\none offer on the property. He knows he's supposed to show the offer to Frank, but\nIra thinks the offer is just too low. So, Ira decides to decline the offer without\nshowing it to Frank and to wait for a better offer to come in.\nChapter 29: Alabama License Law Violations 511",
