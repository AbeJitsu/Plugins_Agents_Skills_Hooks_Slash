Many states\nrequire persons who manage real estate on behalf of other persons or entities to\nbe licensed as real estate brokers. Other states license such persons specifically as\nproperty managers. Real estate firms that handle the sale of commercial and\ninvestment properties are in a natural position to manage those properties for\ntheir owners. Some property managers work for firms that manage multiple\nproperties under blanket management contracts. Others are independent agents.\nSome are employees of the owner. They generally fall into one of the following\ncategories:\n\uf034 individual property manager-- usually a real estate broker who\nmanages properties for one for one or more owners; may belong to\na small property management firm devoted to full-time property\nmanagement, be self-employed, or be one of several managers in a\nlarge real estate firm.\n\uf034 individual building manager-- usually manages a single large\nproperty; may be employed by a property manager or directly by\nan owner; may or may not have a real estate license.\n\uf034 resident manager (residential properties only)-- lives on the\nproperty and may be employed by a real estate broker, a\nmanaging agent or an owner to manage a property on a part-\ntime or full-time basis; may be required by state law for\nproperties of certain types and sizes.\nA manager has a fiduciary relationship with the principal and, in general, is\ncharged with producing the greatest possible net return on the owner's investment\nwhile safeguarding the value of the investment for the owner/investor. At the same\ntime, the manager has some responsibilities to tenants, who want the best value\n380 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

They need technical expertise in marketing,\naccounting, finance, and construction. Property managers often specialize in one\ntype of property - apartment, office, retail, industrial, farm, single-family-and\nacquire specialized knowledge of that property type. Whatever the property type\nand management arrangement, the manager's work involves leasing, managing,\nmarketing, and maintaining the property. The services a manager provides thus\ncan be seen to fall into three areas: financial, physical, and administrative.\nSpecific functions, duties, and responsibilities are determined by the management\nagreement, although most agreements will include at least the following\nfunctions.\nReporting Financial reporting to the principal is a fundamental responsibility of the\nproperty manager. Reports may be required monthly, quarterly, and annually.\nRequired reports typically include an annual operating budget (see below);\nmonthly cash flow reports indicating income, expenses, net operating income,\nand net cash flow; profit and loss statements based on the cash flow reports and\nshowing net profit; and budget comparison statements showing how actual\nresults match the original budget.\nBudgeting An operating budget based on expected expenses and revenues is a necessity\nfor management. The budget will determine rental rates, amounts available for\ncapital expenditures, required reserve funds, salaries and wages of employees,\namounts to be paid for property taxes and insurance premiums and mortgage or\ndebt service. It will indicate the expected return, based on the previous year's\nperformance. A typical budget will contain a projection, also based on past\nperformance and on current market information, of income from all sources,\nsuch as rents and other services, and of expenses for all purposes, such as\noperating expenses, maintenance services, utilities, taxes, and capital\nexpenditures. Operating statements itemizing income and expenses are then\npresented to the owner on a regular basis so that the owner can evaluate the\nmanager's performance against the budget.\nIncome. The total of scheduled rents plus revenues from such sources as\nvending services, storage charges, late fees, utilities, and contracts is the\npotential gross income. Subtracting losses caused by uncollected rents,\nvacancies and evictions gives effective gross income. Operating expenses are\nsubtracted from this total to show net operating income. When debt service and\nreserves (which are not counted as operating expenses) are subtracted, the result\nis cash flow.\nExpenses. Expenses may be fixed or variable. Fixed expenses are those that\nremain constant and may include operating expenses, regular maintenance\ncosts, and administration. Variable expenses are those that may change from\nmonth to month or occur sporadically, such as specific repairs or capital\nexpenditures.\nCapital expenditures. Expected expenditures for major items such as\nrenovation or expansion should be included as a budgeting item. Large-scale\nprojects are typically budgeted over a period of years.\nChapter 23: Property Management 381",

The amount of\nthe reserve is based on experience with variable expenses in previous years.\nRenting The property manager, whose full responsibilities include maintaining and\nmanaging the property in accordance with the owner's financial goals, include\nseeing that the property is properly rented and tenanted. The manager may use\nthe services of a leasing agent, whose concern is solely to rent the space. In such\na situation, some of the manager's tasks may be performed by the leasing agent.\nRenting the property includes the following tasks, regardless of which party is\nactually performing them.\nControlling vacancies. There are many possible reasons for vacancies in a\nbuilding:\n\uf034 rent too high or too low\n\uf034 ineffective marketing\n\uf034 management quality\n\uf034 poor tenant-retention program\n\uf034 image and appearance problems\n\uf034 high market vacancy rate\nSuccessful managers look for these factors and take steps to limit or counteract\ntheir effects.\nMarketing. Finding and attracting the right kind of tenants for a property is the\naim of a marketing program. A marketing plan based on the property's features\nand the relationship between supply and demand in the market area, and\nconsonant with the money available, will determine the best mix of advertising\nand promotional activities. Marketing methods include:\n\uf034 billboard advertising\n\uf034 brochures and fliers\n\uf034 meetings and presentations\n\uf034 networking\n\uf034 newspaper ads\n\uf034 radio and television advertising\n\uf034 signs\n\uf034 tenant referrals\n\uf034 websites and online services\nThe efficiency of marketing activities can be judged in terms of how many\nprospects per completed lease they generate. The lower the cost per prospect per\nlease, the more effective and efficient the program.\nSetting rents. Rental income must be sufficient to cover fixed expenses, operating\nexpenses, and desired return on investment. But rental rates must also be realistic,\ntaking into account what is happening in the market. The manager must consider\nprevailing rents in comparable properties as well as vacancy rates in the market\nand in the property. The manager makes a detailed survey of competitive space\n382 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Residential\napartment rates are stated in monthly amounts per unit, while commercial rates\nare usually stated as an annual or monthly amount per square foot. If vacancy\nrates in the managed property are too high, the manager may have to lower\nrates or identify problems in the property or its management that are\ncontributing to vacancy level. On the other hand, if the property's vacancy rate\nis significantly lower than market rates, the manager may conclude that higher\nrental rates are called for.\nSelecting tenants. To ensure that the property produces the desired level of\nincome from rent, it is essential to find the most suitable tenants. For commercial\nspace, the manager must determine that:\n\uf034 the space meets the tenant's needs for size, configuration, location,\nand quality.\n\uf034 the tenant will be able to pay for the space.\n\uf034 the tenant's business is compatible with that of other tenants.\n\uf034 there is room for expansion if the tenant's need for space is likely\nto grow.\nFor residential space, in addition to ascertaining the tenant's creditworthiness, the\nmanager must be careful to comply with all federal and local fair housing laws. A\nmanager should collect the same type of information on all prospective tenants.\nHowever, even though the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex,\nage and other protected classes, a manager may discriminate in certain other\nways. For example, a manager has the right to refuse to rent to a person who has\na history paying rent late, damaging property, fighting with other tenants, or\nspotty employment.\nCollecting rents. The lease agreement should clearly specify the terms of rental\npayment. The manager must establish a system of notices and records as well as a\nmethod of collecting rents on schedule. Compliance with all state laws and\nregulations concerning collecting and accounting for rents is a necessity to avoid\nunwanted legal complications. As for monies received, the manager must follow\ntrust fund handling procedures established by law and laid out in the rental and\nmanagement agreements. If authorized by the management agreement, the\nmanager may also collect security deposits and handle them as required by law.\nMaintaining tenant relations. Happy tenants remain in a rented space longer\nthan unhappy tenants. High tenant turnover adds to increased advertising and\nredecorating expenses. For these reasons, it is incumbent on the manager to\n\uf034 communicate regularly with tenants\n\uf034 respond promptly and satisfactorily to maintenance and service\nrequests\n\uf034 enforce rules and lease terms consistently and fairly\n\uf034 comply with all relevant laws, such as fair housing and ADA\n(Americans with Disabilities Act) regulations\nChapter 23: Property Management 383",

    "text": "Legal issues (Fair Housing, ADA, and ECOA). Fair housing laws govern\nlandlords and tenants just as they do sellers and buyers. They ensure that persons\nreceive fair treatment regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, sex,\nhandicap, or familial status. Families with children must receive equal treatment\nwith those who do not have children. Landlords cannot charge higher rents or\nsecurity deposits because of the presence of children. Managers must make sure\nthat their marketing and leasing practices are in accordance with fair housing laws.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act similarly requires landlords in certain\ncircumstances to make housing and facilities available to disabled persons\nwithout hindrance. Familiarity with this law and with the latest state, federal, and\nlocal fair housing laws is essential.\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination in lending,\napplies to how property managers evaluate potential tenants. The manager must be\nconsistent in evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants. The same application\nforms and the same credit requirements should be used with all applicants.\nProperty\nmaintenance Physical maintenance of the property is one of the property manager's primary\nfunctions. The costs of services provided must always be balanced with financial\nobjectives and the need to satisfy tenant needs. The manager will also be\nconcerned with staffing and scheduling requirements, in accordance with\nmaintenance objectives.\nMaintenance objectives. The foremost maintenance objective is generally to\npreserve the value of the physical asset for the owner over the long term. Although\nnot every property is best served by vast expenditures on top-level maintenance, it\nis almost always important to maintain the viability of the property as a rental.\nThree general types of maintenance are required to keep a property in serviceable\ncondition: routine, preventive, and corrective.\nRoutine maintenance. Routine maintenance activities are those necessary for the\nday-to-day functioning of the property. Regular performance of these activities\nhelps to keep tenants satisfied as well as forestall serious problems requiring\nrepair or correction. Routine activities are such things as:\n\uf034 regular inspections\n\uf034 scheduled upkeep of mechanical systems-heating, air-\nconditioning, rest rooms, lighting, landscaping\n\uf034 regular cleaning of common areas\n\uf034 minor repairs\n\uf034 supervision of purchasing\nPreventive maintenance. Preventive maintenance goes beyond the routine in\nattempting to deal with situations that can become serious problems if ignored.\nSeasonal or scheduled replacement of appliances and equipment, regular painting\nof exterior and interior areas, and planned replacement of a roof are a few\nexamples.\n384 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Corrective maintenance. When routine and preventive maintenance fail, repairs\nand replacements become mandatory to keep the property operational. A boiler\nmay develop a leak, an air-conditioning unit may break down, an elevator may\ncease to function properly.\nMaintenance contracting. Depending on building type and size, tenant needs,\nand budgetary constraints, a manager may decide to hire an outside firm to\nhandle maintenance services rather than hiring on-site employees. Efficiency,\ncompetence, responsiveness, and effective cost will be major deciding factors.\nConstruction Commercial and industrial property managers are regularly called upon to make\nalterations to existing space to accommodate a tenant's needs. They may also\nhave to undertake or oversee construction that alters or expands common areas or\nthe entire building itself. Again, such work may be contracted out or done by in-\nhouse employees.\nTenant improvements. Alterations made specifically for certain tenants are\ncalled build-outs or tenant improvements. The work may involve merely painting\nand re-carpeting a rental space, or erecting new walls and installing special\nelectrical or other systems. In new buildings, spaces are often left incomplete so\nthat they can be finished to an individual tenant's specifications. In such cases, it\nis important to clarify which improvements will be considered tenant property\n(trade fixtures) and which will belong to the building.\nRenovations. When buildings lose functionality (become functionally\nobsolescent), they generally also lose tenants, drop in class, and suffer declining\nrental rates. Maintenance becomes more expensive because of the difficulties of\nservicing out-of-date building components. Renovation may solve some of these\nproblems, but the manager will have to help the owner determine whether the\ncosts of renovation can be recovered by increased revenues resulting from the\nrenovation.\nEnvironmental concerns. A variety of environmental concerns confronts a\nproperty manager, ranging from air quality to waste disposal, tenant concerns,\nand federal, state and local environmental regulations. The managed property\nmay contain asbestos, radon, mold, lead, and other problematic substances.\nTenants may produce hazardous waste. The manager must be aware of the issues\nand see that proper procedures are in place to deal with them, including providing\nmeans for proper disposal of hazardous materials, arranging for environmental\naudits and undertaking possible remediation. For instance, an audit may show\nthat a building is causing tenants to become sick because of off-gassing from\nconstruction materials combined with a lack of ventilation. Remediation may\nconsist of nothing more than replacing carpets and improving ventilation, and the\nmanager, if empowered to do so, should take the necessary steps.\nLegal concerns (ADA). The Americans with Disabilities Act requires managers to\nensure that disabled employees and members of the public have the same level of\naccess to facilities as is provided for those who are not disabled. Employers with\nat least fifteen employees must follow nondiscriminatory employment and hiring\npractices. Reasonable accommodations must be made to enable disabled\nemployees to perform essential functions of their jobs. Modifications to the\nChapter 23: Property Management 385",

Existing barriers must be removed when the removal is \"readily\nachievable,\" that is, when cost is not prohibitive. New construction and\nremodeling must meet a higher standard, Managers must be aware of the laws\nand determine whether their buildings meet requirements. If not, the manager\nmust determine whether restructuring or retrofitting or some other kind of\naccommodation is most practical.\nRisk management Many things can go wrong in a rented property, from natural disaster to personal\ninjury to terrorism to malfeasance by employees. Huge monetary losses for the\nowner, in the form of civil and criminal penalties, legal costs, fines, damages, and\ncosts of remediation can be the result. A manager must consider the possibility of\nsuch events and have a plan for dealing with them.\nRisk management strategies. Depending on the nature of the risk, the size of the\npotential losses, the likelihood of its happening, and the costs of doing something\nabout it, a manager and owner will generally choose one or more of the following\nrisk management strategies:\n\uf034 avoidance-removing the source of the risk, such as by closing off a\ndangerous area of the building\n\uf034 reduction-taking action to forestall the event before it happens,\nsuch as by installing fire alarms, sprinklers, and security systems\n\uf034 transference-shifting the risk to someone else by buying an\ninsurance policy\n\uf034 retention-taking the chance that the event is not likely enough to\noccur to justify the expense of one of the other strategies; self-\ninsurance\nSecurity and safety. A court may hold a manager and owner responsible for\nthe physical safety of employees, tenants, and customers in leased premises. In\naddition to standard life safety and security systems such as sprinklers, fire\ndoors, smoke alarms, fire escapes, and door locks, a manager may have to\nprovide electronic and human monitoring systems (security cameras, security\nguards) and be prepared to take action against tenants who allow, conduct or\ncontribute to dangerous criminal activities such as assault and drug use.\nInsurance. Many types of insurance are available to allow for the shifting of\nliability away from the owner. An insurance audit by a competent insurance\nagent will indicate what kind of and how much coverage is advisable. Common\ntypes of insurance coverage for income and commercial properties include:\n\uf034 casualty-coverage for specific risks, such as theft, vandalism,\nburglary, illness and accident, machinery damage\n386 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Current\nreplacement value, which is more expensive, is the amount it would cost to\nrebuild or replace the property at current rates.\nCommercial policies include coinsurance clauses requiring the insured to bear a\nportion of the loss.

An estate for years may be for any definite period\u2014years, months,\nweeks, days. When the estate expires, the lessee must return the premises to the\nlessor and vacate the premises. Most commercial leases grant this type of estate.\nPeriodic. An estate from period-to-period does not have any definite period.\nSuch an estate begins as a lease for a definite period but continues after the\nexpiration of the lease, as long as the lessee continues to pay rent at the regular\ninterval, the lessor accepts it, and no one gives notice to terminate the lease. This\ntype of leasehold is common with residential properties.\nAt will. A tenancy at will is similar to the periodic tenancy, except that it does\nnot begin with a definite period. It continues, with the consent of the lessor, as\nlong as the tenant pays rent at regular intervals. It is terminated by the death of\neither party. The tenancy at will is rarely, if ever, used in a written lease.\nAt sufferance. A tenancy or estate at sufferance comes into existence when a\ntenant stays beyond the expiration of another type of lease without the lessor\u2019s\npermission. This type of tenancy is never intentionally used in a written lease.\nLeases, depending on how rent is determined, are also defined as gross, net,\npercentage leases, and graduated leases.\nGross. In a gross lease, the tenant pays an established, fixed rent, and the\nlandlord pays all property operating expenses, such as taxes, insurance, utilities,\nand other services. This is the arrangement commonly used in residential leases.\nNet. Net leases have the tenant paying rent plus some or all of the operating\nexpenses attributable to the rented space. This arrangement is commonly used in\noffice and industrial leases.\nPercentage. A percentage lease may be gross or net, but the rent is not fixed, but\ndepends on the income generated by the tenant in the leased property. A common\narrangement is to set a fixed base rent plus a percentage of the tenant\u2019s gross\nincome or sales at the site. The percentage calculation may take effect only\n392 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "when the income reaches a certain level. This arrangement is commonly used in\nretail leases.\nGraduated. Either a gross or a net lease may also be a graduated lease, in which\nthe rental rate increases at specified times over the lease term.\nOwned and leased\ninclusions The lease should set forth items that are excluded or included in the leased\nproperty. For instance, a residential lease may include built-in appliances such as\ndishwashers but exclude freestanding ones, such as refrigerators. Furniture may\nbe included or excluded. At issue for the landlord is the cost of maintenance. If a\nrefrigerator is not included, it does not have to be maintained by the property\nmanager.\nOwnership also relates to insurance policies: one can only insure what one owns,\nso if a property item is destroyed by fire, the owner's policy will not provide any\ncoverage for an item that is not included in the lease as belonging to the property.\nThis may be of critical importance in a commercial lease where certain\nimprovements might be owned by either the landlord or the tenant, according to\nthe lease.\nThe lease should also have clear rules about making alterations. If the tenant is\nnot satisfied with an item that is part of the property, the lease may provide for\nthe tenant to make changes only with permission or with the obligation to return\nthe premises to their original condition on termination, or that any alterations\nmade to fixtures become the property of the landlord. Trade fixtures, by\ndefinition, belong to the tenant and can be removed when the tenant leaves.\nInclusions may also be of a financial nature-what is included in the rent. Principal\nand interest on a mortgage loan, homeowner's association dues, common area\nmaintenance charges, liability and hazard insurance, and various operating\nexpenses are items that might be included in the lease as the owner's or the\ntenant's responsibilities.\nReversionary rights\nof owners Like the grantor of a life estate, the grantor of a leasehold estate retains a future\ninterest in the estate. The lease grants a number of rights to the property,\nincluding, primarily, the rights to enter, possess, and use the property for the\nterm of the lease. The lessee does not enjoy the full bundle of rights to the\nproperty. For instance, the lessee may not encumber or sell the property. When\nthe lease expires ( a condition subsequent), all rights revert to the original\nowner. A common example is the leasing of an apartment for a one-year period.\nWhen the lease expires, the lessee has no further rights in the property and full\nownership reverts to the lessor. Another condition subsequent that may cause\nreversion of rights is tenant default.\nLandlord rights\nand responsibilities State law, often incorporating or modeling the Universal Residential Landlord\nTenant Act (see below) prescribes rights and responsibilities for residential\nlandlords and tenants.\nRights. Commonly, the landlord retains a right of entry into the premises in order\nto perform needed repairs and maintenance on a property. The lease and/or the\nlaw may specify that a landlord may enter the tenant's property only under one or\nmore of the following conditions:\nChapter 23: Property Management 393",

At the end of the lease term, the landlord has the\nright to retake possession of the premises. In case of tenant breach or default, the\nlandlord has the right to pursue the remedies provided by law, such as eviction, to\ntake possession.\nResponsibilities. The landlord (by way of the property manager), is expected to\ndeliver a property that is habitable. This means that the landlord at the very least\nmust:\n\uf034 keep the heating, cooling, electrical, and plumbing systems in good\nworking condition\n\uf034 keep floors, stairways and railings safe and in good repair\n\uf034 provide pest control as needed\n\uf034 repair roof leaks and broken windows promptly.\nTenant rights\nand responsibilities Rights. Beyond the right to quiet enjoyment (privacy) of a property received and\nmaintained in a habitable condition, the tenant has other rights, depending on\nstate law. For instance, a tenant may be able to take any of the following actions\nif a landlord fails to correct a problem that is the landlord's responsibility:\n\uf034 move out without liability for back rent or the unexpired portion of\nthe lease\n\uf034 refer the problem to mediation, arbitration or small claims court\n\uf034 after giving the owner written notification of an emergency\nsituation, call a professional repair person and deduct the cost\nfrom the next month's rent.\nResponsibilities. Depending on state law, a tenant generally must:\n\uf034 Pay rent on time\n\uf034 Follow the rules and regulations set out by the landlord\n\uf034 Give a 30-day notice when terminating a month-to-month lease\n\uf034 Return all door and mailbox keys when leaving the property\n\uf034 Leave the unit in as clean a condition as it was at the start of the\nlease\n\uf034 Keep the unit clean and sanitary\n\uf034 Dispose of all rubbish, garbage and other waste in a sanitary manner\n394 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The landlord must serve notice on the tenant a specified number of\ndays before beginning the eviction suit. A court issues a judgment for possession,\nwhich requires the tenant to vacate. A court officer, such as a sheriff, may\nforcibly remove the tenant and possessions if the tenant refuses to vacate. The\nlandlord can then enter and take possession.\nA constructive eviction occurs when a tenant vacates the leased premises and\ndeclares the lease void, claiming that the landlord's actions have made the\npremises unfit for the purpose described in the lease. The tenant must prove that\nit was the landlord's actions that were responsible and may be able to recover\ndamages.\nTenant\nimprovements As discussed earlier, leased spaces are often modified to a tenant's specifications.\nSuch alternations may be made by the landlord on the tenant's behalf or by the\ntenant. Buildings usually have \"standard\" improvements, which any tenant\nimprovements must equal or improve on. Many leases have a clause that requires\nthe tenant to return the premises to the condition in which they were received at\nthe end of the lease term. Who pays for improvements and who owns them are\nmajor matters for negotiation.\nTermination of\na lease Like contracts in general, leases may terminate in a number of ways. Principal\namong these are the following. See the chapters on leases and contract law for\nmore information.\nExpiration. A lease with a term (estate for years) automatically expires at the\nend of the term.\nPerformance. Any contract terminates when all parties have performed their\nobligations.\nAgreement. The parties may agree to terminate the lease before the end of the\nterm.\nAbandonment. The landlord may retake possession and pursue the tenant for\ndefault if the tenant abandons the premises and fails to fulfill lease obligations.\nThe tenant's obligation to pay rent continues.\nDefault or Breach. A default occurs when either the tenant or landlord violates\nany of the terms or covenants of the lease. The damaged party may sue for\ndamages, specific performance (of the breached obligation), or cancellation of the\nlease. When the default arises from the tenant's failure to pay rent or maintain the\npremises, the landlord may sue for possession and for eviction. Before filing suit,\nthe landlord must give proper notice and allow the tenant to remedy the breach.\nThe most common form of landlord default is failure to maintain the property and\nprovide services. The tenant may vacate the premises and declare the lease\nChapter 23: Property Management 395",

    "text": "cancelled if the landlord's default has made the premises unoccupiable. This\naction is called constructive eviction.\nNotice. A periodic leasehold or tenancy at will may be terminated by proper\nnotice given by either party.\nDestruction. Property destruction is grounds for termination of the lease.\nCondemnation. Eminent domain proceedings terminate leases.\nForeclosure. Foreclosure actions terminate lease obligations.\nDeath. A tenancy at will terminates on the death of either party. The landlord's\ndeath terminates any lease if the landlord held the leased property under a life\nestate, since the landlord cannot convey an interest that extends beyond the\nlandlord's life.\nSecurity deposit\nProcedures As previously mentioned in the context of handling trust funds, state laws, real\nestate commission rules, and the state\u2019s real estate law, usually specify how a\nproperty manager is to manage security deposits. Such funds are normally held in\na special trust account and may not be used for any purpose other than the\nintended one. Whether the deposit can earn interest, and to whom that interest\nbelongs, are likewise prescribed by law. The law also prescribes when the deposit\nmust be returned to the tenant, and under what circumstances any of it may be\nwithheld. The contract language should clearly state the rules, among other\nthings, governing what happens to the deposit when the lease terminates.\nUniform Residential\nLandlord-Tenant Act The Uniform Residential Landlord-Tenant Act is model legislation that has been\nadopted to a greater or lessor extent in many states. In addition to addressing fair\nand equitable remedies for breaches by both landlord and tenant, the act aims to\nclarify imprecise language in residential leases that can lead to confusion or\nexploitation in such areas as:\n\uf034 lease term\n\uf034 rental amount\n\uf034 security deposit\n\uf034 landlord access\n\uf034 procedures for default and eviction\n\uf034 general obligations of landlord and tenant.\nSee the chapter on \"Real Estate Leases\" for more detail.\n396 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Developing a management plan is a necessary step in\nbeginning a management project, and it may also be part of obtaining a\nmanagement contract. The manager must consider the owner's objectives,\nincluding financial goals; the competitive market for the property, both local and\nregional, depending on the property type; and the features of the particular\nproperty. The plan will take into account market indicators such as vacancy rates,\noccupancy rates, absorption rates, and new supply coming onto the market. It will\nalso include a budgetary component that considers sources of revenue and\nanticipated expenses. Finally, the plan will indicate what the manager intends to\ndo with the property, given these considerations, to manage the property in a way\nthat will meet the owner's objectives.\nChapter 23: Property Management 397",
