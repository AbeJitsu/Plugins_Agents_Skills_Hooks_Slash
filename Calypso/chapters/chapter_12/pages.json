The\nunique characteristic of a listing agreement is that it is governed both by agency\nlaw and by contract law.\nAgency law The cornerstones of agency law in the context of a listing agreement are:\n\uf034 definition of the roles of parties involved\n\uf034 fiduciary duties of the agent\n\uf034 agent's scope of authority\nParties. The principal parties to the contract are the listing broker and the client.\nThe client may be buyer, seller, landlord or tenant in the proposed transaction.\nLegally, the broker is the client's agent. The principal party on the other side of\nthe transaction is a customer or a potential customer, called a prospect. A broker\nor salesperson who assists the listing broker in finding a customer is an agent of\nthe listing broker and a subagent of the client. A broker who represents the party\non the other side of the transaction is an agent of that party, and not an agent of\nthe listing broker, unless a dual agency arrangement is specifically allowed.\nFiduciary duties. A listing agreement establishes an agency relationship between\nagent and client that commits the agent to the full complement of fiduciary duties\nto the client in fulfilling the agreement.\nScope of authority. Customarily, a listing is a special agency, or limited agency,\nagreement. Special agency limits the scope of the broker's authority to specific\nactivities, generally those which generate customers and catalyze the transaction.\nA special agency agreement usually does not authorize a broker to obligate the\nclient to a contract as a principal party, unless the agreement expressly grants\nsuch authorization or the client has granted power of attorney to the broker. For\nexample, a listing broker may not tell a buyer that the seller will accept an offer\nChapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 157",

    "text": "regardless of its terms. Telling the offeror that the offer is accepted would be an\neven more serious breach of the agreement.\nUnder agency law, a client is liable for actions the broker performs that are\nwithin the scope of authority granted by the listing agreement. A client is not\nliable for acts of the broker which go beyond the stated or implied scope of\nauthority.\nThus, in the previous example, the seller would not be liable for the broker's\nstatements that the offer would be accepted or was accepted, since the broker did\nnot have the authority to make such statements. A broker who exceeds the scope\nof authority in the listing agreement risks forfeiting compensation and perhaps\neven greater liabilities.\nContract law Bilateral or unilateral agreement. Listings may be bilateral or unilateral,\ndepending on the type of listing and the wording of the agreement. An open\nlisting is a unilateral agreement in that the seller promises to pay a commission to\nany agent who produces a buyer but no agent promises or is obligated to take any\naction. On the other hand, most exclusive listings are bilateral agreements\nbecause of wording that promises the due diligence of the agent to procure a\nbuyer in return for the seller\u2019s promise to pay a commission if a buyer is\nproduced.\nValidity. A listing agreement must meet the requirements for a valid contract to\nbe enforceable.\nTermination. A listing, like any contract, may terminate for any of the following\ncauses: performance, infeasibility, mutual agreement, rescission, revocation,\nabandonment, lapse of time, invalidity, and breach.\nLegal form. A valid listing may be oral or written. However, many states\nconsider only a written listing to be enforceable, particularly an exclusive right-\nto-sell listing. In practice, a broker should get every listing in writing and make\nsure it clearly states what the broker is authorized to do and how the broker will\nbe paid. An oral listing, even if enforceable, limits a broker's ability to remedy\nproblems:\n\uf034 a contested oral listing must be supported by considerable evidence\nto be enforced\n\uf034 a broker may not be able to sue a principal for damages incurred\nunder an oral lease\n\uf034 if the client dies, the broker may not be able to obtain\ncompensation for a successfully performed oral listing\nAn express listing, verbal or written, manifestly authorizes the broker to pursue\ncertain actions for the client. Clients and agents may also create an implied\nagency listing based on substantive actions rather than on an express agreement.\nFor example, if a seller allows a broker to undertake certain activities toward\neffecting a transaction without a specific authorization, but with full knowledge\nand consent, an implied agency may have been created. Consequently, if the\nprincipal proceeds with a customer procured in this manner, he or she may be\n158 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Since a listing agreement is a personal service contract, it is not\nassignable. In particular, a broker cannot assign a listing to another broker.\nTYPES OF LISTING AGREEMENT\nExclusive right-to-sell (or lease)\nExclusive agency\nOpen listing\nNet listing\nBuyer and tenant agency agreement\nTransaction broker agreement\nMultiple listing\nLimited services agreement\nA broker may represent any principal party of a transaction: seller, landlord,\nbuyer, tenant. An owner listing authorizes a broker to represent an owner or\nlandlord. There are three main types of owner listing agreement: exclusive right-\nto-sell (or lease); exclusive agency; and open listing. Another type of listing,\nrarely used today and illegal in many states, is a net listing. The first three forms\ndiffer in their statement of conditions under which the broker will be paid. The\nnet listing is a variation on how much the broker will be paid.\nA buyer agency or tenant representation agreement authorizes a broker to\nrepresent a buyer or tenant. The most commonly used form is an exclusive right-\nto-represent agreement, the equivalent of an exclusive right-to-sell. However,\nexclusive agency and open types of agreement may be also used to secure a\nrelationship on this side of a transaction.\nThough not a distinct type of listing agreement, multiple listing is a significant\nfeature of brokerage practice. Multiple listing is an authorization to enter a listing\nin a multiple listing service.\nExclusive right-\nto-sell (or lease) The exclusive right-to-sell, also called exclusive authorization-to-sell and,\nsimply, the exclusive, is the most widely used owner agreement. Under the terms\nof this listing, a seller contracts exclusively with a single broker to procure a\nbuyer or effect a sale transaction. If a buyer is procured during the listing period,\nthe broker is entitled to a commission, regardless of who is procuring cause.\nThus, if anyone-the owner, another broker-- sells the property, the owner must\npay the listing broker the contracted commission.\nThe exclusive right-to-lease is a similar contract for a leasing transaction. Under\nthe terms of this listing, the owner or landlord must pay the listing broker a\ncommission if anyone procures a tenant for the named premises.\nThe exclusive listing gives the listing broker the greatest assurance of receiving\ncompensation for marketing efforts.\nChapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 159",

    "text": "In some states, an exclusive right-to-sell listing is enforceable only if it is in\nwriting and has an expiration date. Some states do not require the agreement to\nbe in writing, but if it is in writing, it must have an expiration date.\nExclusive agency An exclusive agency listing authorizes a single broker to sell the property and\nearn a commission, but leaves the owner the right to sell the property without the\nbroker's assistance, in which case no commission is owed. Thus, if any party\nother than the owner is procuring cause in a completed sale of the property,\nincluding another broker, the contracted broker has earned the commission. This\narrangement may also be used in a leasing transaction: if any party other than the\nowner procures the tenant, the owner must compensate the listing broker.\nAn exclusive agency listing generally must have an expiration date. Most states\nallow either an oral or written agreement.\nOpen listing An open listing, or, simply, open, is a non-exclusive authorization to sell or lease\na property. The owner may offer such agreements to any number of brokers in\nthe marketplace. With an open listing, the broker who is the first to perform\nunder the terms of the listing is the sole party entitled to a commission.\nPerformance usually consists of being the procuring cause in the finding of a\nready, willing, and able customer. If the transaction occurs without a procuring\nbroker, no commissions are payable.\nOpen listings are rare in residential brokerage. Brokers generally shy away from\nthem because they offer no assurance of compensation for marketing efforts. In\naddition, open listings cause commission disputes. To avoid such disputes, a\nbroker has to register prospects with the owner to provide evidence of procuring\ncause in case a transaction results.\nAn open listing may be oral or written.\nNet listing A net listing is one in which an owner sets a minimum acceptable amount to be\nreceived from the transaction and allows the broker to have any amount received\nin excess as a commission, assuming the broker has earned a commission\naccording to the other terms of the agreement. The owner's \"net\" may or may not\naccount for closing costs.\nFor example, a seller requires $750,000 for a property. A broker sells the\nproperty for $830,000 and receives the difference, $80,000, as commission.\nNet listings are generally regarded as unprofessional today, and many states have\noutlawed them. The argument against the net listing is that it creates a conflict of\ninterest for the broker. It is in the broker's interest to encourage the owner to put\nthe lowest possible acceptable price in the listing, regardless of market value.\nThus the agent violates fiduciary duty by failing to place the client's interests\nabove those of the agent.\n160 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Exhibit 12.1 Types of Listing\nBuyer and tenant\nagency\nagreements Buyer and tenant agency agreements create a fiduciary relationship with the\nbuyer or tenant just as seller listings create a fiduciary relationship with the seller.\nGenerally, buyer and tenant representation agreements are subject to the same\nlaws and regulations as those applying to owner listings. Thus:\n\uf034 a representation agreement may be an exclusive, exclusive\nagency, or open listing. As with owner listings, the most widely\nused agreement is the exclusive. In this arrangement, the buyer\nagrees to only work with the buyer representative in procuring a\nproperty.\n\uf034 an exclusive listing generally must have an expiration date along\nwith other requirements of a valid listing.\n\uf034 state laws require an exclusive authorization to be in writing\nDuties of the Agent. At the formation of the relationship, the buyer agent has the\nduty to explain how buyer or tenant agency relationships work. This is\nculminated by a signed agreement where the principal understands and accepts\nthese circumstances. During the listing term, the buyer or tenant agent\u2019s principal\nduties are to diligently locate a property that meets the principal\u2019s requirements.\nIn addition, the agent must comply with his or her state agency-disclosure laws\nwhich may differ from those of traditional listing agents. This involves timely\ndisclosures to prospective sellers and their agents, usually upon initial contact.\nTransaction broker\nagreement In terms of agency, a transaction broker is in a non-agency relationship with the\nseller or buyer. The agent is not bound by fiduciary duties to either party.\nNevertheless, transaction brokers enter into binding agreements with buyers and\nsellers to complete transactions. Such agreements may be exclusive or non-\nexclusive. Like conventional listings, the transaction brokerage agreement binds\nthe principal to a compensation agreement in the event the broker procures a\nproperty or a buyer. Typical agreements affirm the nature of the relationship,\nChapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 161",

The agreement must:\n\uf034 be in writing\n\uf034 disclose that the licensee is acting as a limited service\nrepresentative\n\uf034 list the specific services the licensee will provide\n\uf034 state the duties of a standard agent that the limited service\nrepresentative will not provide.\nSome states require a limited service listing agreement to comply with minimum\nservice requirements.\nFULFILLMENT AND TERMINATION\nAgent's performance\nCompensation\nCauses for termination\nRevoking a listing\nA listing agreement may terminate in many ways. The only desirable and\nfavorable way is by fulfillment of the contract.

    "text": "Finding a customer means locating a party who is ready, willing, and able to\ntransact under the client's terms. Effecting a completed transaction means\nfinding a customer who is not only ready, willing, and able, but one who makes\nan acceptable offer.\nA ready, willing, and able customer is one who is:\n\uf034 amenable to the terms of the transaction (ready and willing)\n\uf034 financially capable of paying the price and legally capable of\ncompleting the transaction (able)\nSpecific responsibilities. A listing agreement authorizes a broker to undertake\nactions relevant to achieving the performance objective. Authorized activities\nusually include the following:\n\uf034 show or seek property\n\uf034 locate buyer, seller, tenant, or landlord\n\uf034 communicate the client's transaction terms\n\uf034 promote features and advantages of the terms to customers\n\uf034 assist in negotiating a meeting of the minds between parties\nDue diligence. Due diligence in the listing context refers to verifying the\naccuracy of the statements in the listing regarding the property, the owner, and\nthe owner's representations. Especially important facts for a broker or agent to\nverify are:\n\uf034 the property condition\n\uf034 ownership status\n\uf034 the client's authority to act\nFailure to perform a reasonable degree of due diligence may increase an agent's\nexposure to liability in the event that the property is not as represented or that the\nclient cannot perform as promised.\nDelegation of responsibilities. In the normal course of business, a listing broker\ndelegates marketing responsibilities to salespeople. A salesperson may not,\nhowever, seek compensation directly from a client. Only the broker can obtain\nand disburse the compensation.\nCompensation The main item of performance for the client is payment of compensation, if the\nagreement calls for it. A broker's compensation is earned and payable when the\nbroker has performed according to the agreement. The amount and structure of\nthe compensation, potential disputes over who has earned compensation, and the\nclient's liability for multiple commissions are other matters that a listing\nagreement should address.\nNegotiated compensation. The amount of a broker's commission is whatever\namount the client and broker have agreed to. Compensation may be in the form\nof a percentage of the sale or lease price, or a flat fee.

    "text": "Procuring cause. Disputes often arise as to whether an agent is owed a\ncommission. Many such disputes involve open listings where numerous agents\nare working to find customers for the principal, and none has a clear claim on a\ncommission. In other cases, a client may claim to have found the customer alone\nand therefore to have no responsibility for paying a commission. There are also\nsituations where cooperating brokers and subagents working under an exclusive\nlisting dispute about which one(s) deserve a share of the listing broker's\ncommission.\nThe concept that decides such disputes is that the party who was the \"procuring\ncause\" in finding the customer is entitled to the commission or commission share.\nThe two principal determinants of procuring cause are:\n\uf034 being first to find the customer\n\uf034 being the one who induces the customer to complete the\ntransaction\nFor example, Broker A and Broker B each have an open listing with a property\nowner. Broker A shows Joe the property on Monday. Broker B shows Joe the\nsame property on Friday, and then Joe buys the property. Broker A will probably\nbe deemed to be the procuring cause by virtue of having first introduced Joe to\nthe property.\nCompensation for buyer brokers. Buyer agency agreements stipulate how the\nagent will be compensated in the relationship. The compensation may be a client-\npaid retainer fee or a commission contingent upon a completed transaction or\nprocured seller. It is common practice for the agent to be paid by the customer to\nthe transaction, the seller, as opposed to the fiduciary principal, the buyer or\ntenant. In addition, the agent may be paid by the buyer in the event that the seller\nor listing agent refuses to offer any compensation to the buyer broker. This might\noccur, for example, in the case of a for-sale-by-owner transaction.\nIn addition to the form of compensation and the parties responsible for paying the\nagent, the buyer agency agreement defines when the compensation is in fact\nearned and will be paid. Customarily, the commission is earned when a sales\ncontract is completed by the transacting parties. The agent may be entitled to\ncompensation even if the buyer defaults on the terms of the sales contract.\nNormally, agents are paid at closing or upon the buyer\u2019s default.\nCauses for\ntermination A listing may terminate on grounds of:\n\uf034 performance: all parties perform; the intended outcome\n\uf034 infeasibility: it is not possible to perform under the terms of the\nagreement\n\uf034 mutual agreement: both parties agree to cancel the listing\n\uf034 revocation: either party cancels the listing, with or without the\nright\n\uf034 abandonment: the broker does not attempt to perform\n\uf034 breach: the terms of the listing are violated\n\uf034 lapse of time: the listing expires\n\uf034 invalidity of contract: the listing does not meet the criteria for\nvalidity\n\uf034 incapacitation or death of either party\n164 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

In most states, open listings do not require a\nstated expiration date. Rather, they expire after a \"reasonable\" period of time as\nlocally defined.\nThe other types of listing generally must specify a termination date and may not\nhave an automatic renewal mechanism. Courts in many states construe any listing\nthat has no expiration as an open listing. However, some states make these\nrequirements only of written listings, and may not require exclusives to be in\nwriting.\nRevoking a listing Power vs. right. Both principals to the listing agreement have the power to\nrevoke the contract at any time. They do not, however, always have the right.\nThat is, client or broker may cancel a listing but remain liable for damages to\nthe other party.\nRevocation by the client. If the client revokes the listing after the broker has\nalready earned a commission, the client must pay the commission, no matter what\ntype of listing it was.\nIf the broker has not fully performed prior to the revocation, the following\nguidelines apply:\n\uf034 exclusive right-to-sell: if the property sells during the term of the\nrevoked listing, the client is liable for the commission. If the\nproperty does not sell, the client is liable for the broker's actual\ncosts.\n\uf034 exclusive agency: if the property sells during the term of the\nrevoked listing, the client is liable at least for the broker's costs\nand possibly for the commission.

    "text": "Exclusive buyer\nagency clauses The exclusive buyer agency agreement is very similar to the exclusive right-to-\nsell agreement, the only significant differences being the agent\u2019s objectives and\nthe fact that the principal is the buyer instead of the seller. The notable exception\nis how the agent is paid, as previously discussed.\nThe clauses which are virtually identical to the exclusive right-to-sell are:\n\uf034 the identity of the principal and the agent\u2019s authorized activity\n\uf034 the description of the property desired in terms of location, price,\nsize, etc.\n\uf034 the term of the agreement and its automatic termination\n\uf034 the buyer\u2019s agreement to work exclusively through the agent\n\uf034 the agent\u2019s duties to locate a suitable property according to the\nbuyer\u2019s specifications\n\uf034 the non-discrimination clause\n\uf034 signatures of the parties\nThe following clauses distinguish the buyer agency agreement from the exclusive\nright-to sell agreement.\nBuyer\u2019s representation of exclusivity. Here the buyer affirms that he or she is\nnot represented by another agent. In addition the buyer acknowledges an\nunderstanding of the agency relationship.\nAgent compensation. This clause sets forth how the agent is to be paid, whether\nby retainer or commission, who is to pay the commission, and what the buyer\nowes the agent in the event the seller does not participate in the agent\u2019s\ncompensation. Second, the clause establishes the circumstances under which the\nagent has earned the commission. This includes finding a property during the\nagreement term or the buyer contracting to buy a property shown by the agent\nwithin a stipulated period of time following expiration. In addition, the clause\nprovides that the agent will be paid in the event the buyer defaults on a sale\ncontract.\nOther buyers acknowledged. In this provision, the buyer acknowledges that the\nagent is working with other buyers who may be in competition for any property\nthe buyer is shown by the agent.\nTransaction\nbrokerage clauses Transaction brokerage agreements vary greatly among the states where this\nbrokerage relationship is practiced. The agreement may be exclusive or non-\nexclusive. Despite the lack of standardization and uniformity, these agreements\ncontain the following principal provisions.\nParties and property identification. The agreement identifies the principals and\nif a seller, the description of the property to be sold, or if a buyer a description of\nthe property desired.\nAgent\u2019s authorized activity.

    "text": "Non-agency declaration. The agreement clearly sets forth that it is a non-agency\npersonal services contract with a legally binding effect. This provision expressly\nstates that the broker is not an agent of the buyer or seller and is not acting in a\nfiduciary capacity. In addition, the principal agrees that the agent is not working\nfor the benefit of either party nor advocating the interests of either party. Usually\nthis clause requires the principal\u2019s acknowledgment that he or she has read a\nstate-level approved document describing and explaining the forms of agency or\nnon-agency relationships practiced in that state.\nTransaction broker duties. Like other listings, this clause defines what\nactivities the agent will undertake to earn compensation. Key words are \u2018assist,\u2019\nor \u2018offer information\u2019 or \u2018facilitate\u2019 as opposed to \u2018represent.\u2019 Activities include\nweb searches, showings, advertising, etc.\nOther buyers acknowledged. If a buyer agreement, the buyer will acknowledge\nthat the agent is working with other buyers who may be in competition for any\nproperty the buyer is shown by the agent.\nCompensation. This clause stipulates what the agent will be paid, by whom, and\nupon what circumstances, much like the buyer agency agreement. The clause will\nlikely include that the compensation may be partially or wholly provided by the\nseller.
