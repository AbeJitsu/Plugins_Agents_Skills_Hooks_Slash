Mayer\nEqual Opportunity in Housing poster\nFair Housing Amendments Act of 1988\nDiscrimination by the client\nViolations and enforcement\nFair financing laws\nAmericans with Disabilities Act\nFederal and state governments have enacted laws prohibiting discrimination in\nthe national housing market. The aim of these fair housing laws, or equal\nopportunity housing laws, is to give all people in the country an equal\nopportunity to live wherever they wish, provided they can afford to do so,\nwithout impediments of discrimination in the purchase, sale, rental, or financing\nof property.\nState Fair Housing Laws. While states have enacted fair housing laws that\ngenerally reflect the provisions of national law, each state may have slight\nmodifications of national law. For that reason, it is incumbent upon real estate\nstudents to learn their state laws and, in particular, note where these laws differ\nfrom national fair housing laws.\nFair Housing and Local Zoning. The Fair Housing Act prohibits a broad range\nof practices that discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, color,\nreligion, sex, national origin, familial status, and disability. The Act does not pre-\nempt local zoning laws. However, the Act applies to municipalities and other\nlocal government entities and prohibits them from making zoning or land use\ndecisions or implementing land use policies that exclude or otherwise\ndiscriminate against protected persons, including individuals with disabilities.\nChapter 20: Professional Practices 305",

    "text": "Civil Rights\nAct of 1866 The original fair housing statute, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, prohibits\ndiscrimination in housing based on race. The prohibition relates to\nselling, renting, inheriting, and conveying real estate.\nExecutive Order 11063. While the Civil Rights Act of 1866 prohibited\ndiscrimination, it was only marginally enforced. In 1962, the President issued\nExecutive Order 11063 to prevent discrimination in residential properties\nfinanced by FHA and VA loans. The order facilitated enforcement of fair housing\nwhere federal funding was involved.\nCivil Rights Act\nof 1968 Title VIII (Fair Housing Act). Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, known\ntoday as the Fair Housing Act, prohibits discrimination in housing based on race,\ncolor, religion, or national origin. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal\nOpportunity (FHEO) administers and enforces Title VIII under the supervision\nof the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\nForms of illegal\ndiscrimination The Fair Housing Act specifically prohibits such activities in residential brokerage\nand financing as the following.\nDiscriminatory misrepresentation. An agent may not conceal available\nproperties, represent that they are not for sale or rent, or change the sale terms for\nthe purpose of discriminating. For example, an agent may not inform a minority\nbuyer that the seller has recently decided not to carry back second mortgage\nfinancing when in fact the owner has made no such decision.\nDiscriminatory advertising. An agent may not advertise residential properties in\nsuch a way as to restrict their availability to any prospective buyer or tenant.\nProviding unequal services. An agent may not alter the nature or quality of\nbrokerage services to any party based on race, color, sex, national origin, or\nreligion. For example, if it is customary for an agent to show a customer the latest\nMLS publication, the agent may not refuse to show it to any party. Similarly, if it\nis customary to show qualified buyers prospective properties immediately, an\nagent may not alter that practice for purposes of discrimination.\nSteering. Steering is the practice of directly or indirectly channeling customers\ntoward or away from homes and neighborhoods. Broadly interpreted, steering\noccurs if an agent describes an area in a subjective way for the purpose of\nencouraging or discouraging a buyer about the suitability of the area.\nFor example, an agent tells Buyer A that a neighborhood is extremely attractive,\nand that desirable families are moving in every week. The next day, the agent\ntells Buyer B that the same neighborhood is deteriorating, and that values are\nstarting to fall. The agent has blatantly steered Buyer B away from the area and\nBuyer A into it.\nBlockbusting. Blockbusting is the practice of inducing owners in an area to sell\nor rent to avoid an impending change in the ethnic or social makeup of the\nneighborhood that will cause values to go down.\n306 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

It is discriminatory to restrict participation in\nany multiple listing service based on one's race, religion, national origin, color,\nor sex.\nRedlining. Redlining is the residential financing practice of refusing to make\nloans on properties in a certain neighborhood regardless of a mortgagor's\nqualifications. In effect, the lender draws a red line around an area on the map\nand denies all financing to applicants within the encircled area.\nTitle VIII exemptions The Fair Housing Act allows for exemptions under a few specific circumstances.\nThese are:\n\uf034 a privately owned single-family home where no broker is used\nand no discriminatory advertising is used, with certain additional\nconditions\n\uf034 rental of an apartment in a 1-4 unit building where the owner is also\nan occupant, provided the advertising is not discriminatory\n\uf034 facilities owned by private clubs and leased non-commercially to\nmembers\n\uf034 facilities owned by religious organizations and leased non-\ncommercially to members, provided membership requirements\nare not discriminatory\nJones v. Mayer In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled in Jones v. Mayer that all discrimination in\nselling or renting residential property based on race is prohibited under the\nprovisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Thus, while the Federal Fair Housing\nAct exempts certain kinds of discrimination, anyone who feels victimized by\ndiscrimination based on race may seek legal recourse under the 1866 law.\nEqual Opportunity\nin Housing poster In 1972, HUD instituted a requirement that brokers display a standard HUD\nposter. The poster affirms the broker's compliance with fair housing laws in\nselling, renting, advertising, and financing residential properties. Failure to\ndisplay the poster may be construed as discrimination.\nFair Housing\nAmendments\nAct of 1988 Amendments to federal fair housing laws prohibit discrimination based on sex\nand discrimination against handicapped persons and families with children.\nExemptions. Federal fair housing laws do not prohibit age and family status\ndiscrimination under the following circumstances:\n\uf034 in government-designated retirement housing\n\uf034 in a retirement community if all residents are 62 years of age or\nolder\n\uf034 in a retirement community if 80 % of the dwellings have one\nperson who is 55 years of age or older, provided there are\namenities for elderly residents\nChapter 20: Professional Practices 307",

If an agent goes along with a client's\ndiscriminatory act, the agent is equally liable for violation of fair housing laws. It\nis thus imperative to avoid complicity with client discrimination. Further, an\nagent should withdraw from any relationship where client discrimination occurs.\nExamples of potential client discrimination are:\n\uf034 refusing a full-price offer from a party\n\uf034 removing the property from the market to sidestep a potential\npurchase by a party\n\uf034 accepting an offer from one party that is lower than one from\nanother party\nViolations and\nenforcement Persons who feel they have been discriminated against under federal fair housing\nlaws may file a complaint with the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity\n(FHEO) within HUD, or they may file suit in a federal or state court.\nFiling an FHEO complaint.

HUD then initiates an investigation in conjunction with federal or\nlocal enforcement authorities.\nIf HUD decides that the complaint merits further action, it will attempt to resolve\nthe matter out of court. If efforts to resolve the problem fail, the aggrieved party\nmay file suit in state or federal court.\nFiling suit. In addition to or instead of filing a complaint with HUD, a party may\nfile suit in state or federal court within two years of the alleged violation.\nPenalties. If discrimination is confirmed in court, the respondent may be enjoined\nto cease practicing his or her business. For example, a discriminating home builder\nmay be restrained from selling available properties to buyers. Also, the plaintiff\nmay be compensated for damages including humiliation, suffering, and pain. In\naddition, the injured party may seek equitable relief, including forcing the guilty\nparty to complete a denied action such as selling or renting the property. Finally,\nthe courts may impose civil penalties for first-time or repeat offenders.\nFair financing laws Parallel anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws have been enacted in\nthe mortgage financing field to promote equal opportunity in housing.\nEqual Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). Enacted in 1974, the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act requires lenders to be fair and impartial in determining who\nqualifies for a loan. A lender may not discriminate on the basis of race, color,\nreligion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age. The act also requires lenders\nto inform prospective borrowers who are being denied credit of the reasons for\nthe denial.\n308 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Many states require sellers to make a written\ndisclosure about property condition to a prospective buyer. This seller disclosure\nmay or may not relieve the agent of some liabilities for disclosure. The\nresidential property condition disclosure is the seller\u2019s written summary of the\nproperty\u2019s condition at the time of contracting for sale. The disclosure is entered\non state-approved forms.\nOwner\u2019s role. State legislation requires owners of previously occupied single\nfamily homes and buildings containing 1-4 dwelling units to provide the\ndisclosure to prospective buyers if they are selling, exchanging, or optioning their\nproperty. Some exceptions and exemptions apply. When required, the disclosure\nmust be transmitted to the prospective buyer no later than when the buyer makes\nan offer.\nA typical form requires the seller to affirm whether or not problems exist in any\nof the listed features and systems of the property. In denying that a problem\nexists, the seller claims to have no knowledge of a defect. If a defect does in fact\nexist, the seller can be held liable for intentional misrepresentation. A third\npossible response to a property condition question is that of \u201cno representation.\u201d\nHere, the seller makes no claim of knowledge as to whether a problem exists.\nWith this answer, the seller is no longer held liable for a disclosure of any kind\nrelating to a particular feature, whether a defect is known or otherwise.\nChapter 20: Professional Practices 311",

If an agent is involved in the transaction, the agent must disclose any and\nall material facts he or she knows or should reasonably know about the property,\nregardless of what the seller may have disclosed on the form.\nRight of rescission. Sellers who fail to complete and deliver the property\ncondition disclosure statement to buyers in a timely fashion effectively give the\nbuyer a subsequent right under certain conditions to rescind the sale contract and\nre-claim their deposits. The buyer must follow certain procedures and meet\ncertain deadlines in order to legitimately effect the cancellation. The buyer\u2019s right\nto cancel persists until closing or occupancy, whichever comes first.\nProperty condition and material facts. As explained in the chapter on agency,\nan agent has the duty to inform the client of all material facts, reports, and\nrumors that might affect the client's interests in the property transaction. A\nmaterial fact is one that might affect the value or desirability of the property to a\nbuyer if the buyer knew it. Material facts include\n\uf034 the agent's opinion of the property's condition\n\uf034 adverse facts about property condition, title defects,\nenvironmental hazards, and property defects\nIn recent years, the disclosure standard has been raised to require an agent to\ndisclose items that a practicing agent should know, whether the agent actually\nhad the knowledge or not, and regardless of whether the disclosure furthers or\nimpedes the progress of the transaction.\nFacts not considered to be material, and therefore not usually subject to required\ndisclosure, include such items as property stigmatization (e.g., that a crime or\ndeath occurred on the property) and the presence of registered sex offenders in\nthe neighborhood (in accordance with Megan\u2019s Law, federal legislation that\nrequires convicted offenders to register with the state of residence; in some\nstates, agents must provide registry information to buyers).\nThe agent may be held liable for failing to disclose a material fact if a court rules\nthat the typical agent in that area would detect and recognize the adverse\ncondition. There is no obligation to obtain or disclose information that is\nimmaterial to the transaction, such as property stigmas.\nAn agent who sees a \u201cred flag\u201d issue such as a potential structural or mechanical\nproblem should advise the seller to seek expert advice.

    "text": "Environmental\nissues Health hazards occur within structures, on real estate parcels, and in the area\nsurrounding real estate. They may occur naturally or as a result of human\nactivity. Environmental laws regulate some, but not all, health hazards that affect\nreal estate. Real estate agents, owners, and sellers have various responsibilities\nfor detecting, disclosing, and remediating regulated hazards. Some important\nissues are reviewed below. There is further information in the \u201cEnvironmental\nControls\u201d section of Chapter 8.\nLead-based paint. This hazard cannot be absorbed through the skin, but it\nbecomes dangerous when it is ingested or inhaled. It can be found in most homes\nbuilt before 1978 and can be present in the air, drinking water, food,\ncontaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust from the paint. Children are\nparticularly susceptible because young children are known to eat chips of the\npaint, allowing the lead to enter their bloodstreams. Homebuyers and renters are\nrequired to be given the EPA-HUD-US Consumer Product Safety Commission's\nbooklet, \"Protect Your Family from Lead in Your Home\" and must be informed\nif lead-based paint is present in the home. Buyers may have a risk assessment\nperformed prior to purchasing the home.\nMold. This is a fungus that grows under moist conditions and causes allergic\nreaction for some people. The presence of mold in the home must be disclosed as\na latent defect. Flooding and water damage must also be disclosed as both of\nthose can lead to mold growth. Inspections do not always find mold because it\noften grows inside walls and ductwork. Most molds require removal by a\nprofessional.\nAsbestos. While harmless in its original condition, it can cause lung cancer if its\ndust filters into the air. If it is found in a home during remodeling, it must be\nremoved by professionals to prevent contamination. It can be found in roofing\nand siding, older insulation, textured paint, artificial ashes sold for gas fireplaces,\nsome vinyl floor tiles, coatings for older hot water and steam pipes.\nAir quality. The quality of air in a home can be adversely impacted by the\npresence of carbon monoxide, radon, deteriorating asbestos and lead-based paint,\nmethamphetamine production, formaldehyde, and other toxic chemicals. Homes\ncan and should be tested for many of these contaminants prior to purchase.\nWater quality. Ground water is easily contaminated from septic tanks,\nagricultural runoff, highway de-icing, landfills, pesticides, animal waste, etc.\nMany people rely on ground water for drinking so must be aware that\ncontaminated water can cause problems from mild stomach problems to cancer\nand death. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets standards for\nprotecting ground water from contamination. It also offers advice and resources\nto facilitate the rehabilitation of contaminated ground water sources. One such\nmeans of protection is to advise private well users to have the water tested at least\nonce a year.\nCarbon monoxide. This is an odorless, colorless, toxic gas that can kill a person\nbefore its presence is known. It can be caused by unvented kerosene and gas\nspace heaters; leaking chimneys; back-drafting from furnaces, gas water heaters,\nwood stoves, and fireplaces; gas stoves, gasoline powered equipment, vehicle\n316 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "exhaust in garages, tobacco smoke. Carbon monoxide can be detected in a\nstructure by a unit similar to a smoke alarm which should be included in every\nhome, especially those with gas equipment and fireplaces or furnaces.\nFaulty septic systems. Inspections of septic systems are important because these\nsystems take wastewater from the property, remove most of the contaminants,\nand then put the water into the soil. If the system is faulty, it can be releasing\ncontaminated water into the soil, thereby contaminating the soil. Potential buyers\nand septic system users should have the county health department conduct an\ninspection of the system.\nIllegal drug manufacturing. Manufacturing illegal drugs such as\nmethamphetamine produces highly toxic fumes that last a long time. Continued\nexposure to the fumes can cause fatal burns to the lungs, can damage the liver\nand spleen, and can lead to learning disabilities. Any property suspected as\nhaving been a place for drug manufacturing should be investigated prior to being\nsold or leased, and the possible health hazards must be disclosed to the potential\nbuyer or renter.\nRadon. This is the easiest hazard to detect and mitigate. It is an odorless,\ncolorless, tasteless, and radioactive gas that is created in the ground where\nuranium and radium exist. Prolonged exposure to radon can cause lung cancer. It\ncan enter the home through any cracks, gaps, or cavities, including crawl spaces\nand openings around pipes. It can be easily detected by a radon test, so home\ninspections should include this test.\nUrea formaldehyde. This type of hazard is found in foam thermal insulation in\nhomes built before 1980. The formaldehyde gas emissions from the insulation\ndecrease over time, so most homes with the insulation no longer pose a threat.\nThe most common sources of formaldehyde in a home are pressed wood products\nsuch as particleboard, hardwood plywood paneling, and medium density\nfiberboard. Plastic furniture, new carpeting, and other vinyl materials also emit\nformaldehyde gases during the first few months after installation. Formaldehyde\ncan cause eye problems, nausea, breathing problems, and allergic reactions.\nLeaking underground storage tanks. USTs have at least 10 percent of their\nvolume underground and are used to store fuel oil, gasoline, and other toxic\nfluids. Tanks made of steel can corrode over time and leak their contents into the\nsurrounding soil, contaminating groundwater. They also provide a potential for\nfire and explosion. Tank removal is expensive, so removal is not common.\nTherefore, potential buyers must be informed of the presence of a UST on the\nproperty and of the health and financial risks of purchasing a property that\ncontains a UST.\nClean Air and Clean Water Acts. The Clean Air Act of 1963, since amended a\nnumber of times, was designed to control air pollution on a national level.\nAmong other things, the act authorizes the setting of standards for controlling the\nemission of pollutants and monitoring air quality. It identifies hazardous air\npollutants such as formaldehyde and regulates their use. Importantly, the act\nallows private citizens to sue other citizens to enforce the law.\nThe Clean Water Act, officially known as the Federal Water Pollution Control\nAct Amendments of 1972, together with revisions contained in the Clean Water\nChapter 20: Professional Practices 317",

The Clean Water Act does not directly deal with groundwater\ncontamination, which is addressed in the Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act, and the Superfund act.\nSafe Drinking Water Act. Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act\n(SDWA) in 1974 (amended 1986 and 1996) to regulate and protect the public\nsupply of drinking water. The act authorizes the setting of standards, protection\nof water sources, training of operators, funding of improvements, and\ndissemination of information. Under the act, water suppliers must report health\nrisks to the EPA within 24 hours of discovery. Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) oil\nand gas production poses one of the greatest current threats to groundwater.\nProperty sellers generally must disclose the source of drinking water for the\nproperty and the presence, type and location of any septic system on the property.\nA water supply other than a municipal one and any septic system other than a\nstandard one should be tested.\nBrownfields Law. Brownfields are abandoned commercial or industrial sites that\nare likely to contain toxic material. The Small Business Liability Relief and\nBrownfields Revitalization Act (known as the Brownfields Law), passed in 2002\nprovides clean-up funds, liability protections, and tax incentives to reclaim\ncontaminated properties. Under this law, owners who neither caused nor\ncontributed to the contamination are released from liability for the clean up.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. The EPA was established on December 2,\n1970 to bring together federal research, monitoring, standard-setting and\nenforcement activities into one agency dedicated to environmental protection.\nThe EPA, working with state, local, and tribal governments, enforces the Clean\nAir and Clean Water Acts along with other environmental laws.\nDisclosure obligations and liabilities. As discussed in an earlier chapter,\nlicensees are expected to be aware of environmental issues and to know where to\nlook for professional help. They are not expected to have expert knowledge of\nenvironmental law nor of physical conditions in a property. Rather, they must\ntreat potential environmental hazards in the same way that they treat other\nmaterial facts about a property: disclosure. It is advisable to have an attorney\ndraft the appropriate disclosures to lessen the broker's liability should problems\noccur in the future.\nThe Lead-based Paint Act of 1992 requires a seller or seller\u2019s agent to disclose\nknown lead problems in properties built before 1978. The licensee must give\nthe buyer or lessee a copy of the EPA-HUD-US Consumer Product Safety\nCommission booklet, \u201cProtect Your Family from Lead in your home.\u201d\nFurther, the 1996 lead-based paint regulation requires sellers or lessors of almost\nall residential properties built before 1978 to disclose known lead-based paint\nhazards and provide any relevant records available.

Purchasers of home warranties need to fully understand their\ncoverage limitations in order to have realistic expectations of the warranty.\nSimilarly, it is important for a homeowner to understand what may not be\ncovered in the warranty. These items may include\n\uf034 conditions that existed prior to the effective coverage of the\nwarranty\n\uf034 failures caused by something other than normal wear and tear\n\uf034 improperly installed or modified items\n\uf034 damages caused by failure of another system or appliance, such as\nkitchen cabinets being damaged from a plumbing leak in the pipes\nunder the sink, called consequential damages\n\uf034 outdoor items such as sprinklers or swimming pool\n\uf034 repairs to faucets\n\uf034 refrigerators, washers and dryers, or garage door openers are often\nnot covered\nChapter 20: Professional Practices 319",

    "text": "Basically, unless an item is specifically listed in the warranty contract, it will not\nbe covered.\nWith a home warranty, the homeowner must go through the warranty company to\nhave the service performed. The company usually has established relationships\nwith specific service providers and may use only those providers for service\nunder the warranty. The homeowner is typically charged a service fee on top of\nthe annual fee for each repair job.\nInspections Process. Property inspections may identify builder oversights or the need for\nmajor repairs. They may also identify the need for regular maintenance to keep\nthe property in good condition. In addition to looking for structural issues,\nplumbing and electrical problems, and roof and foundation issues, inspections\ncan uncover termites or other pests that are damaging the structure. Inspections\ncan also uncover environmental issues that have a detrimental impact on the\nproperty.\nTermite inspections. Termites are destructive pests that exist in all states except\nAlaska. They cause an estimated $50 billion in damage to buildings each year.\nThey often cause extensive damage to the property before the owner even\nrealizes there is a problem. Termites eat wood from the inside out, so they are not\neasily discovered except by professional inspectors. Having homes inspected\nannually for termites can prevent substantial damage and cost.\nThe most common type of termite is the subterranean termite. They are often\nconfused with winged ants, but they are much more destructive. Termite\ninspectors look for the following indications that termites are present in the\nstructure:\n\uf034 swarms of termites inside the home\n\uf034 termite excrement\n\uf034 termite bodies found in spider webs near the structure\n\uf034 the presence of termite mud tubes by which termites traverse open\nspaces between sources of wood; the tubes protect the termites from\ndehydration and predators; their diameter is similar to that of a\ndrinking straws\n\uf034 areas on the property that serve to harbor termites, such as wood\nfencing, mulch, piles of firewood, dead tree limbs, etc.\n\uf034 a hollow sound when a wood beam is tapped\n\uf034 long, deep grooves in wood\nBecause termites cause such extensive damage and can live inside the structure of\na home for years, a termite inspection should be part of any home buying\ntransaction as well as a periodic event.\n320 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Environmental inspections. Home inspections should include looking for\ncommon environmental issues that can affect the property and the residents of the\nproperty. Environmental hazards can have a significant impact on the sale of a\nproperty. An environmental site assessment (ESA) may be conducted to identify\nenvironmental impairments and protect parties against becoming involved in\ncontamination issues. Such assessments are performed in three phases. A Phase 1\nESA identifies potential problems on or near the subject property. A Phase 2 ESA\ninvolves active testing of soil, water, and other components of the subject\nproperty.\nEnvironmental impact statements. When a project is federally funded, the\nresponsible parties must provide an environmental impact statement (EIS)\ndetailing how the project will affect the environment. Privately funded projects\nare also often required to prepare an EIS before any permits are issued. An EIS is\nexpected to address air and water quality issues, noise, health and safety, wildlife,\nvegetation, water and sewer requirements, traffic, population density, and other\nissues as appropriate.\nAgent disclosure duties. Most states require disclosure of known material facts\nregarding residential properties of one to four units. If a licensee knows the result\nof an inspection, this is a material fact to be disclosed. Disclosure of\nenvironmental issues on commercial and industrial properties is often not\nmandated. Where disclosure is not required, real estate licensees should suggest\nthe use of a professional environmental audit.\nHomeowners\u2019\nassociations States have various requirements for a seller\u2019s property condition disclosure\nstatement to be completed by the seller and furnished to the buyer. Any such\ndisclosure is likely to include whether the property is subject to a common\ninterest property plan (e.g. condominium), whether the plan imposes any\nrestrictions, whether membership in a Homeowners\u2019 Association (HOA) is\nobligatory, and the identity of the HOA, if any.\nState law will typically require the association or management company to\nprovide association documents to the buyer to satisfy the seller disclosure\nrequirements. These documents may be attached to or delivered in conjunction\nwith the sale contract. The contract itself usually specifies the timing of the\ndisclosures. There may be a place on the contract for the buyer to acknowledge\nreceipt and knowledge of the HOA disclosures. In some states, the seller\u2019s agent\ngathers and provides the documents to a buyer or buyer\u2019s agent before the writing\nof an offer.\nA typical HOA disclosure package includes\n\uf034 declarations\n\uf034 articles of incorporation\n\uf034 bylaws\n\uf034 articles of organization\n\uf034 operating agreements\n\uf034 rules and regulations\n\uf034 party wall agreements\n\uf034 minutes of annual owners\u2019 meeting\n322 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The agent\u2019s\nresponsibility is to make sure the disclosures are made.\nOTHER PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES\nCodes of ethics\nJob performance\nDuties to clients\nDuties to customers\nDisclosure\nWholesaling\nLove letters\nProfessional relationships\nCodes of ethics The real estate industry has developed a code of professional standards and ethics\nas a guideline in serving the real estate needs of consumers. This professional\ncode has emerged from three primary sources:\n\uf034 federal and state legislation\n\uf034 state real estate licensing regulation\n\uf034 industry self-regulation through trade associations and institutes\nFederal legislation focuses primarily on anti-discrimination laws and fair trade\npractices. State laws and licensing regulations focus on agency and disclosure\nrequirements and regulating certain brokerage practices within the state\njurisdiction. Real estate trade groups focus on professional standards of conduct\nin every facet of the business.\nBy observing professional ethics and standards, licensees will serve clients and\ncustomers better, foster a professional image in the community, and avoid\nregulatory sanctions and lawsuits.\nToday's professional ethics are not only important for one's career; they are also\nlegal imperatives.\nTrade associations representing the real estate industry have instituted their own\ncodes of ethics and professional practices covering every facet of brokerage\nactivity. For the latest Code of Ethics of the National Association of\nREALTORS\u00ae, see https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar/governing-\ndocuments/code-of-ethics/2023-code-of-ethics-standards-of-practice .\nChapter 20: Professional Practices 323",

    "text": "The standards of most codes for real estate licensees concern the following\ngeneral areas of practice.\nJob performance A professional real estate agent must understand the skills and knowledge the\nprofession requires and make a commitment to maintain and improve expertise\nin these areas. Of particular importance are:\n\uf034 market knowledge\n\uf034 real estate laws\n\uf034 evolving standards of practice\nOther aspects of professional performance that are usually supported include:\n\uf034 promoting exclusive listings\n\uf034 promoting the professionalism of the real estate industry\n\uf034 promoting arbitration of disagreements rather than litigation\n\uf034 obtaining transactional agreements between parties in writing\n\uf034 submitting offers and counteroffers in a timely and objective\nmanner\n\uf034 keeping the funds of others separate from broker and personal\nfunds\n\uf034 providing equal professional services to all persons\n\uf034 providing services only within the agent\u2019s area of competence or\nwith the assistance of a specialist\n\uf034 observing the highest standards of truthfulness in advertising\n\uf034 cooperating with real estate boards and commissions in their\nenforcement of standards\nA real estate professional must recognize the limits of the agent's role and avoid\npracticing other professions beyond the agent's qualifications, such as law,\ninvestment counseling, securities brokerage, and tax advising.\nDuties to clients Most codes of ethics uphold the commitment to fulfill fiduciary duties. Specific\napplications include:\n\uf034 honestly representing market value and property condition\n\uf034 respecting rights and duties of other client-agent relationships\n\uf034 submitting all offers\n\uf034 avoiding commingling and conversion\n\uf034 keeping transaction documents current\n\uf034 maintaining confidentiality\n\uf034 managing client property competently\nDuties to customers Some of the guidelines for working with customers are:\n\uf034 honestly representing market value and property condition\n\uf034 avoiding calling a service \"free\" that in fact is contingent on\nreceiving a commission\n\uf034 advertising truthfully\n324 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The wholesaler finds a willing seller, puts\nthe property under contract, and finds a third-party buyer willing to buy at a\nhigher price than what the wholesaler has agreed to pay the original seller. At\nclosing, the wholesaler assigns the contract to the ultimate buyer; the ultimate\nbuyer settles with the original seller and pays the wholesaler the difference in the\ntwo contracts as a fee.\nSome states require the wholesaler in such transactions to hold a real estate\nlicense.\nLove letters Buyers sometimes try to enhance the attractiveness of a purchase offer by\nattaching a personal note to the offer. This appeal to the seller, called a \u201clove\nletter,\u201d typically mentions such things as why the buyer particularly likes the\nhome, how the buyer imagines family life in the home, and how well the buyer\nwill care for the home.\nThe practice is discouraged in some states and by some real estate associations as\ncreating the possibility of liability for fair housing violations. Since the letter may\ndivulge information about such characteristics of the buyer as race, religion, or\nfamilial status, it could be construed as providing an unlawful basis for the\nseller\u2019s decision to accept or reject an offer.\nSome sellers explicitly refuse to accept these love letters. Best practice is to\navoid the use of love letters and find other ways to make the offer attractive.\nProfessional\nrelationships Professional conduct excludes disparagement of competitors. Real estate\nprofessionals also\n\uf034 forgo pursuit of unfair advantage\n\uf034 arbitrate rather than litigate disputes\n\uf034 respect the agency relationships of others\n\uf034 conform to accepted standards of co-brokerage practices\nChapter 20: Professional Practices 325",
