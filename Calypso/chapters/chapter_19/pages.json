Real estate\nproperty taxes are imposed by \"taxing entities\" or \"taxing districts\" at county and\nlocal levels of government.\nThere are no federal taxes on real property. The Constitution of the United States\nspecifically prohibits such taxes. The federal government does, however, tax\nincome derived from real property and gains realized on the sale of real property.\nThe federal government can impose a tax lien against property for failure to pay\nany tax due the Internal Revenue Service.\nState government States may legally levy taxes on real property, but most delegate this power to\ncounties, cities, townships and local taxing districts. Some states place limits on\nhow local governments may levy such taxes. States may impose a tax lien against\nproperty for failure to pay any real property taxes which the state has levied or\ndelegated to local taxing bodies.\nCounty and local\ngovernment Counties, cities and municipalities, townships and special tax districts levy taxes\non real property to raise funds for providing local services. It is common for the\ncounty to collect all real property taxes and distribute it among the other taxing\nbodies.\nTax districts County and local governments establish tax districts to collect funds for\nproviding specific services. The boundaries of such districts typically do not\ncoincide with municipal boundaries. The major tax district in most areas is the\nschool district. Other important tax districts are those for fire protection,\ncommunity colleges, and parks.\nA property tax bill might include tax levies from such districts as the following\nChapter 19: Real Estate Taxation 297",

For instance, a special tax district might be\ncreated to fund extension of municipal water service to a newly incorporated\narea. Unlike a permanent tax district such as the school district, a special tax\ndistrict is temporary, ceasing to exist once the costs of the specific project have\nbeen paid for.\nAD VALOREM TAXATION\nTax base totalling\nHomestead exemption\nOther exemptions\nTax rate derivation\nTax billing and collection\nGeneral property taxes are levied on an ad valorem basis, meaning that they are\nbased on the assessed value of the property. Assessed value is determined\naccording to state law, usually by a county or township assessor or appraiser.\nThe actual tax, though based on assessed value, may be derived as a legislated\npercentage of the assessed value. Land and improvements may be assessed\nseparately. Ad valorem taxes are paid annually.\nTax base totalling The tax base of an area is the total of the appraised or assessed values of all\nreal property within the area's boundaries, excluding partially or totally exempt\nproperties:\ntax base = assessed values - exemptions\nTaxing entities generate the annual revenues they require by levying taxes on the\ntax base. The tax rate, or millage rate, determines how much of a tax levy the\ntax base will receive. The tax rate for each taxing entity is calculated by dividing\nthe amount of revenue required by the tax base. This rate is then applied to the\ntaxable value of each individual real property to determine its tax levy.\nValue assessment. County or township officers, called assessors or appraisers,\nvalue the real property within their jurisdiction for purposes of levying taxes.\nThis valuation process results in an assessed value. Assessment practices differ\nfrom state to state. In many states, assessed value does not reflect the market\nvalue that an appraisal for other purposes might aim to estimate. For instance, in\nsome areas, assessors use a sales comparison approach to assess the value of land\nand a cost approach to value improvements.\n298 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The role of the assessor in the taxing process is limited to making the valuation\nand notifying the owner of the assessed value; other tax officials determine the\ntax rate and the tax levy.\nEqualization. Some taxing bodies recognize that local assessments can lead to\nunfairly high or low values for properties in certain areas. Therefore the\njurisdiction may establish equalization factors to level out the unevenness of\nvaluations. For instance, if assessed values of properties in one county are\nconsistently ten percent below the average for other counties, an equalization\nboard may multiply each assessed value in that county by a factor of 110% to\nraise them to the average level for the state.\nAppeals. Property owners may object to the assessed value of their property, but\nnot to the tax rate. An owner usually has a certain period to protest after receiving\nnotice of the assessed value. According to local law, a property owner must\npresent evidence that the assessor made an error to a review board or appeal\nboard. Typical evidence would include market data on comparable properties that\nsold recently, or evidence that neighboring properties had less appreciation or\neven declined in assessed value in comparison with the protestor's property. An\nowner who is dissatisfied with the actions of the appeals or review board can take\nthe protest to court.\nHomestead\nexemption A homestead is a parcel of real property that is owned and occupied as a family\nhome. Some states exempt a portion of the value of the homestead from\njudgments to protect families against eviction by creditors. States and counties\nmay exempt a portion of the assessed value of the principal residence from\nproperty taxation.\nA property owner generally qualifies for a homestead exemption by meeting two\ncriteria:\n\uf034 is head of a family\n\uf034 resides on the property for a required length of time\nSome states also allow a single person to claim the homestead exemption.\nDepending on state law, home owners may have to apply every year for the\nexemption, or they may receive it automatically without filing.\nOther exemptions Properties. Most states exempt certain types of property from property taxes.\nCertain classes of property owner may also be exempted or have a reduced\nliability. Exempted are:\n\uf034 government-owned properties\nreal properties owned by federal, state, and local governments are\nimmune from real property taxation\nChapter 19: Real Estate Taxation 299",

Miscellaneous exemptions may be granted to classes of property\nowner, such as: senior citizens, widows, and disabled individuals.\nStates and municipalities may also offer property tax reductions or exemptions to\ncertain industries to encourage economic growth.\nTax rate derivation Tax district budgeting. The derivation of a tax rate, or millage rate, begins with\nthe taxing body determining its funding requirements to provide services for the\nyear. This requirement is formalized in the annual budget. Then the county or\ndistrict looks at its sources of revenue, such as sales taxes, business taxes, income\ntaxes, state and federal grants, fees, and so forth. The part of the budgeted\nexpenditures that cannot be funded from other income sources must come from\nreal property taxes. This budgetary shortfall becomes the ad valorem tax levy.\nThe tax levy is derived every year, since budget requirements and revenue tallies\nare performed on an annual cycle.\nTax rate. Each individual taxing body has its own tax rate. The tax rate is\ndetermined by dividing the taxing body's budgeted amount to be collected from\nreal estate taxes by the tax base:\ntax requirement\n--------------------- = tax rate (millage rate)\ntax base\nIf, for example, a taxing body needs $500,000 from property taxes, and the tax\nbase for the district is $15,000,000, the tax rate for this body is:\n500,000\n------------- = .03\n15,000,000\nThis tax rate of .03 or 3% may be expressed in a number of ways, depending on\nlocal practice: as mills, as dollars per $100 of assessed value, or as dollars per\n$1,000 of assessed value. A mill is one one-thousandth of a dollar ($.001). A tax\nrate of one mill means that the owner pays one dollar for every thousand dollars\nof assessed value. Thus the rate of .03 above could be expressed as:\n30 mills\n$3 per $100\n$30 per $1,000\n3 percent\nTax rate limitations. Some states, counties or other taxing districts place\nlimitations or caps on the absolute millage rate or the annual increase in millage\nfor property taxes. In such situations, taxing bodies are forced to limit their\nbudget requirements, unless there has been a sufficient increase in tax base to\nproduce the required funds without raising the millage rate.\n300 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Tax billing and\ncollection Individual owner billings. Each property owner's tax bill is determined by\nmultiplying the tax rate for each taxing district times the taxable value of the\nproperty. Taxable value is the assessed value after all exemptions and\nadjustments have been taken into account.\nFor example, a certain property is owned and occupied as a primary residence\nand qualifies for a homestead exemption. The assessed value of the property is\n$240,000, and the exemption is $75,000. The property is taxed by the school\ndistrict at a rate of 5 mills, and by the county at a rate of 2 mills. The property tax\nbill for these items would be calculated as follows.\nExhibit 19.1 Tax Bill Calculation\nI. Taxable Value\nassessed value $ 240,000\n- homestead exemption $ 75,000\ntaxable value $ 165,000\nII.

Totaling\nschool tax $ 825\n+ county tax $ 330\ntotal tax bill $ 1,155\nPayment deadlines are usually set by law and differ from region to region.\nDifferent taxing bodies may have different fiscal years, and as a result may issue\ntax bills at different times of the year. It is more common for a county to issue a\nbill that consolidates the bills of all the lesser taxing bodies. The consolidated bill\nmay be payable annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or on some other schedule as\nprescribed by law. In many cases where the owner has a mortgage and a required\nescrow account, the escrow officer will pay the tax bill. The owner will only\nreceive notice of the assessed value and the tax statement.\nSPECIAL ASSESSMENTS\nA special assessment is a tax levied against specific properties that will benefit from\na public improvement. Common examples are assessments for sidewalks, water\nservice and sewers. Special assessments are based on the cost of the\nChapter 19: Real Estate Taxation 301",

The project cost is $200,000. Although there are 100 properties in\nthe subdivision, only the 50 that are directly on the canal stand to benefit.\nTherefore, assuming each canal-front lot receives equal benefit, the 50 properties\nare each assessed $4,000 as a special assessment tax. Note that once the work is\ncompleted and paid, the assessment is discontinued.\nIf a taxing entity initiates an assessment, the assessment creates an involuntary\ntax lien. If property owners initiate the assessment by requesting the local\ngovernment to provide the improvement, the assessment creates a voluntary tax\nlien.\nSpecial assessments are usually paid in installments over a number of years.\nHowever, taxpayers generally have the option of paying the tax in one lump sum\nor otherwise accelerating payment.\nTAX LIEN ENFORCEMENT\nSale of tax certificates\nTax deed\nTax sale\nIf taxes remain unpaid for a period of time specified by state law, the tax\ncollecting agency may enforce the tax lien in several ways, depending on what\nthe law prescribes.\nSale of tax\ncertificates Some states sell tax certificates. The buyer of a tax certificate agrees to pay the\ntaxes due. After a period of time specified by law, the holder of the tax certificate\non a property may then apply for a tax deed.\nTax deed A tax deed is a legal instrument for conveying title when a property is sold for\nnon-payment of taxes. The application for a tax deed causes the taxing agency to\ninstitute a tax sale or tax foreclosure.\nTax sale A tax sale is frequently some type of auction. If the tax has not already been paid\nthrough the tax certificate process, the buyer of the property must pay the taxes\ndue. There is usually a legally-prescribed redemption period during which the\ndefaulted taxpayer has the right to buy back the property and reclaim title. If the\ntaxpayer can redeem the property by paying the delinquent taxes and any other\ncharges before the tax sale occurs, this right is known as an equitable right of\nredemption. If the taxpayer can redeem the property after the tax sale, this right is\nknown as a statutory right of redemption. In this case, the taxpayer must pay the\namount paid by the winning bidder at the tax sale, plus any charges, additional\ntaxes, or interest that may have accumulated. If the defaulted taxpayer does not\nredeem the property within the allotted time, the state issues the tax deed to\nconvey title.\n302 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",
