As American history demonstrates, unregulated use of real estate has\nsignificant potential for eventual damage to property values as well as to the\nenvironment. Moreover, with the explosive urban growth in this century, it has\nbecome clear that regulation of land use is necessary to preserve the interests,\nsafety, and welfare of the community.\nWithout a central authority to exert control, land use tends to be chaotic. For\nexample, rapid growth can outpace the support capabilities of basic municipal\nservices such as sewers, power, water, schools, roads and communications. On\nan aesthetic level, communities need controls to keep certain commercial and\nindustrial land uses away from residential areas to avoid the undermining of\nproperty values by pollution, noise, and traffic congestion.\nGoals of land use\ncontrol Over time, public and private control of land use has come to focus on certain\ncore purposes. These are:\n\uf034 preservation of property values\n\uf034 promotion of the highest and best use of property\n\uf034 balance between individual property rights and the public good,\ni.e., its health, safety and welfare\n\uf034 control of growth to remain within infrastructure capabilities\n\uf034 incorporation of community consensus into regulatory and\nplanning activities\nThe optimum management of real property usage must take into account both\nthe interests of the individual and the interests of the surrounding community.\nWhile maintaining the value of an individual estate is important, the owner of\nan estate must realize that unregulated use and development can jeopardize\nthe value not only of the owner's estate but of neighboring properties.\nSimilarly, the community must keep in mind the effect of government actions\nChapter 8: Land Use Planning and Control 101",

A\nplanning commission manages the master plan and enforces it by exercising\nits power to establish zones, control building permits, and create building\ncodes.\nIn addition to public land use planning and control, some private entities,\nsuch as subdivision associations, can impose additional standards of land use\non owners within the private entity's legal jurisdiction. Private controls are\nprimarily implemented by deed restrictions.\nThe master plan Public land use planning incorporates long-term usage strategies and growth\npolicies in a land use plan, or master plan. In many states, the process of land\nuse planning begins when the state legislature enacts laws requiring all counties\nand municipalities to adopt a land use plan. The land use plan must not only\nreflect the needs of the local area, but also conform to state and federal\nenvironmental laws and the plans of regional and state planning agencies. The\nstate enforces its planning mandates by giving state agencies the power to\napprove county and local plans.\nThe master plan therefore fuses state and regional land use laws with local land\nuse objectives that correspond to the municipality's social and economic\nconditions. The completed plan becomes the overall guideline for creating and\nenforcing zones, building codes, and development requirements.\n102 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Planning objectives The primary objectives of a master plan are generally to control and\naccommodate social and economic growth.\nAmount of growth. A master plan sets specific guidelines on how much growth\nthe jurisdiction will allow. While all communities desire a certain degree of\ngrowth, too much growth can overwhelm services and infrastructure.\nTo formulate a growth strategy, a plan initially forecasts growth trends, then\nestimates how well the municipality can keep pace with the growth forecast. The\noutcome is a policy position that limits building permits and development\nprojects to desired growth parameters. A growth plan considers:\n\uf034 nature, location and extent of permitted uses\n\uf034 availability of sanitation facilities\n\uf034 adequacy of drainage, waste collection, and potable water systems\n\uf034 adequacy of utilities companies\n\uf034 adequacy and patterns of thoroughfares\n\uf034 housing availability\n\uf034 conservation of natural resources\n\uf034 adequacy of recreational facilities\n\uf034 ability and willingness of the community to absorb new taxes,\nbond issues, and assessments\nGrowth patterns. In addition to the quantity of growth, a master plan also\ndefines what type of growth will occur, and where. Major considerations are:\n\uf034 the type of enterprises and developments to allow\n\uf034 residential density and commercial intensity\n\uf034 effects of industrial and commercial land uses on\nresidential and public sectors, i.e., where to allow such uses\n\uf034 effect of new developments on traffic patterns and thoroughfares\n\uf034 effects on the environment and environmental quality (air, water,\nsoil, noise, visual aspects)\n\uf034 effect on natural resources that support the community\n\uf034 code specifications for specific construction projects\nAccommodating demand. As the master plan sets forth guidelines for how\nmuch growth will be allowed, it must also make plans for accommodating\nexpanding or contracting demand for services and infrastructure.

Where necessary, it may force property owners to sell their property\nthrough the power of eminent domain.\nZoning Zoning is the primary tool by which cities and counties regulate land use and\nimplement their respective master plans. The Constitution grants the states the\nlegal authority to regulate, and the states delegate the authority to counties and\nmunicipalities through legislation called enabling acts.\nThe zoning ordinance. The vehicle for zoning a city or county is the zoning\nordinance, a regulation enacted by the local government. The intent of zoning\nordinances is to specify land usage for every parcel within the jurisdiction. In\nsome areas, state laws permit zoning ordinances to apply to areas immediately\nbeyond the legal boundaries of the city or county.\nZoning ordinances implement the master plan by regulating density, land\nuse intensity, aesthetics, and highest and best use. Ordinances typically\naddress:\n\uf034 the nature of land use-- office, commercial, residential, etc.\n\uf034 size and configuration of a building site, including setbacks,\nsidewalk requirements, parking requirements, and access\n\uf034 site development procedures\n\uf034 construction and design methods and materials, including\nheight restrictions, building-to-site area ratios, and\narchitectural styles\n\uf034 use of space within the building\n\uf034 signage\nOrdinance validity. Local planners do not have unlimited authority to do\nwhatever they want. Their zoning ordinances must be clear in import, apply to\nall parties equally, and promote health, safety, and welfare of the community in\na reasonable manner.\nBuilding permits. Local governments enforce zoning ordinances by issuing\nbuilding permits to those who want to improve, repair, or refurbish a property.\nTo receive a permit, the project must comply with all relevant ordinances and\ncodes. Further zoning enforcement is achieved through periodic inspections.\nTypes of zones. One of the primary applications of zoning power is the\nseparation of residential properties from commercial and industrial uses. Proper\ndesign of land use in this manner preserves the aesthetics and value of\nneighborhoods and promotes the success of commercial enterprises through\nintelligently located zones.\nChapter 8: Land Use Planning and Control 105",

Sub-zones in this category may limit the type of retail or office\nactivity permitted, for example, a department store versus a strip center.\nCommercial zoning regulates:\n\uf034 intensity of usage, by limiting the area of store or office per site\narea.

A county or local board, usually called the\nzoning board of adjustment or zoning appeals board, administers zoning\nordinances. The board rules on interpretations of zoning ordinances as they apply\nto specific land use cases presented by property owners in the jurisdiction. In\neffect, the zoning board is a court of appeals for owners and developers who\ndesire to use land in a manner that is not entirely consistent with existing\nordinances.\nThe board conducts hearings of specific cases and renders official\ndecisions regarding the land use based on evidence presented.\nA zoning board generally deals with such issues and appeals as:\n\uf034 nonconforming use\n\uf034 variance\n\uf034 special exception or conditional use permit\n\uf034 zoning amendment\nIf the board rejects an appeal, the party may appeal the ruling further in a court\nof law.\nExhibit 8.2 Zoning Appeals\nNon- Special\nconforming exception\nuse\n--public good\n--legal\n--illegal\nZoning Board\nof\nAdjustment\nVariance Amendment\n--hardship --change\nzone\nNonconforming use. A nonconforming use is one that clearly differs from\ncurrent zoning. Usually, nonconforming uses result when a zoning change\nleaves existing properties in violation of the new ordinance. This type of\nnonconforming use is a legal nonconforming use. A board usually treats this\nkind of situation by allowing it to continue either\nChapter 8: Land Use Planning and Control 107",

    "text": "\uf034 indefinitely\n\uf034 until the structures are torn down\n\uf034 only while the same use continues, or\n\uf034 until the property is sold\nFor instance, a motel is situated in a residential area that no longer allows\ncommercial activity. The zoning board rules that the motel may continue to\noperate until it is sold, destroyed or used for any other commercial purpose.\nAn illegal nonconforming use is one that conflicts with ordinances that\nwere in place before the use commenced. For instance, if the motel in the\nprevious example is sold, and the new owner continues to operate the\nproperty as a motel, the motel is now an illegal, nonconforming use.\nVariance. A zoning variance allows a use that differs from the applicable\nordinance for a variety of justifiable reasons, including that:\n\uf034 compliance will cause unreasonable hardship\n\uf034 the use will not change the essential character of the area\n\uf034 the use does not conflict with the general intent of the ordinance\nFor example, an owner mistakenly violates a setback requirement by two feet.\nHis house is already constructed, and complying with the full setback now\nwould be extremely expensive, if not impossible. The zoning board grants a\nvariance on the grounds that compliance would cause an unreasonable hardship.\nA grant of a zoning variance may be unconditional, or it may require\nconditions to be fulfilled, such as removing the violation after a certain time.\nSpecial exception. A special exception grant authorizes a use that is not\nconsistent with the zoning ordinance in a literal sense, yet is clearly beneficial\nor essential to the public welfare and does not materially impair other uses in\nthe zone.\nA possible example is an old house in a residential zone adjacent to a retail\nzone. The zoning board might grant a special exception to a local group that\nproposes to renovate the house and convert it to a local museum, which is a\nretail use, since the community stands to benefit from the museum.\nAmendment. A current or potential property owner may petition the zoning\nboard for an outright change in the zoning of a particular property. For example,\na property zoned for agricultural use has been idle for years. A major employer\ndesires to develop the property for a local distribution facility, which would\ncreate numerous jobs, and petitions for an amendment. The board changes the\nzoning from agricultural to light industrial to permit the development. Since a\nchange in zoning can have significant economic and social impact, an appeal for\nan amendment is a difficult process that often involves public hearings.\nSubdivision\nregulation In addition to complying with zoning ordinances, a developer of multiple\nproperties in a subdivision must meet requirements for subdivisions.\n108 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Many states have adopted policies that require developers,\nespecially of subdivisions, to take responsibility for the impact of their projects\non the local infrastructure by taking corrective action. Concurrency is a policy\nthat requires the developer to make accommodations concurrently with the\ndevelopment of the project itself, not afterwards. For example, if a project will\ncreate a traffic overload in an area, the developer may have to widen the road\nwhile constructing the project.\nFHA requirements. In addition to local regulation, subdivisions must meet FHA\n(Federal Housing Authority) requirements to qualify for FHA financing\ninsurance. The FHA sets standards similar to local ordinances to ensure an\nadequate level of construction quality, aesthetics, and infrastructure services.\nBuilding codes Building codes allow the county and municipality to protect the public against\nthe hazards of unregulated construction. Building codes establish standards for\nvirtually every aspect of a construction project, including offsite improvements\nsuch as streets, curbs, gutters, drainage systems, and onsite improvements such\nas the building itself.\nBuilding codes typically address:\n\uf034 architectural and engineering standards\n\uf034 construction materials standards\n\uf034 building support systems such as life safety, electrical,\nmechanical, and utility systems\nCertificate of occupancy.

However, if the private party is\nunwilling to sell, the government may purchase the property anyway. The power\nto do this is called eminent domain.\nEminent domain. Eminent domain allows a government entity to purchase a fee,\nleasehold, or easement interest in privately owned real property for the public\ngood and for public use, regardless of the owner's desire to sell or otherwise\ntransfer any interest. In exchange for the interest, the government must pay the\nowner \"just compensation.\"\nTo acquire a property, the public entity initiates a condemnation suit. Transfer of\ntitle extinguishes all existing leases, liens, and other encumbrances on the\nproperty. Tenants affected by the condemnation sale may or may not receive\ncompensation, depending on the terms of their agreement with the landlord.\nPublic entities that have the power of eminent domain include:\n\uf034 all levels of government\n\uf034 public districts (schools, etc.)\n\uf034 public utilities\n\uf034 public service corporations (power companies, etc.)\n\uf034 public housing and redevelopment agencies\n\uf034 other government agencies\nTo acquire a property, the public entity must first adopt a formal resolution to\nacquire the property, variously called a \u201cresolution of necessity.\u201d The resolution\nmust be adopted at a formal hearing where the owner may voice an opinion. Once\nadopted, the government agency may commence a condemnation suit in court.\nSubsequently, the property is purchased and the title is transferred in exchange for\njust compensation. Transfer of title extinguishes all existing leases, liens, and\nother encumbrances on the property. Tenants affected by the condemnation sale\nmay or may not receive compensation, depending on the terms of their agreement\nwith the landlord.\nIn order to proceed with condemnation, the government agency must demonstrate\nthat the project is necessary, the property is necessary for the project, and that the\nlocation offers the greatest public benefit with the least detriment.\nAs an eminent domain proceeding is generally an involuntary acquisition, the\ncondemnation proceeding must accord with due process of law to ensure that it\ndoes not violate individual property rights. Further, the public entity must justify\nits use of eminent domain in court by demonstrating the validity of the intended\npublic use and the resulting \u201cpublic good\u201d or \u201cpublic purpose\u201d ultimately served.\n110 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The issue of eminent domain versus individual property rights has recently come\nunder scrutiny in light of a 2005 Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the rights of\nstate and local governments to use the power of eminent domain for urban re-\ndevelopment and revitalization. The ruling allowed that private parties could\nundertake a project for profit without any public guarantee that the project would\nbe satisfactorily completed. The ruling brought the issue of \u201cpublic use\u201d into\nquestion, as the use of the re-development could well be private and even a\nprivate for-profit enterprise. The winning argument was that the \u201cpublic purpose\u201d\nis served when redevelopment creates much needed jobs in a depressed urban\narea.

Such\nrestrictions are also referred to as \"covenants, conditions, and restrictions,\" or\nCCRs. A quitclaim deed can terminate a private deed restriction.\nTypical restrictions concern:\n\uf034 required minimum area of a residence\n\uf034 setback\n\uf034 prohibition against construction of sheds or secondary buildings\n\uf034 prohibition against conducting certain commercial activities\nDeed restrictions may not be discriminatory by restricting ownership or use on\nthe basis of race, religion, marital status, or gender.\nRestrictions on commercial property use may not violate fair trade and anti-trust\nlaws.\nDeclaration\nrestriction The declaration of a subdivision, Planned Unit Development, condominium, and\ncommercial or industrial park contains private use restrictions.

If, however, owners in a subdivision or park allow a violation to\ncontinue for a sufficient length of time, they can lose their right to legal recourse.\nDeed condition A deed condition may restrict certain uses of a property, much like a deed\nrestriction.

This act created the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) and the Council for Environmental Quality, giving\nthem a mandate to establish environmental standards for land use planning. The\nact also required environmental impact surveys on large development projects.\nClean Air Amendment (1970). This act authorized the EPA to establish air\nquality standards for industrial land uses as well as for automobile and airplane\nemissions.\nWater Quality Improvement Act (1970), the Water Pollution Control\nAct amendment (1972), the Clean Water Act Amendment (1977).\nThese acts addressed standards to control water pollution and industrial\nwastes from the standpoints of future prevention as well as remediation of\nexisting pollution.\nResource Recovery Act (1970), the Resource Conservation and\nRecovery Act (1976), the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\nCompensation and Liability Act (Superfund) (1980), the Superfund\nAmendment and Reauthorization Act (1986). These acts addressed\ndisposal of solid and toxic wastes and measures for managing waste. In\naddition, the Superfund act provided money for hazardous waste disposal\nand the authority to charge cleanup costs to responsible parties.\nLead-based paint ban (1978) and Residential Lead-based Paint\nHazard Reduction Act (1992, 1996). These regulations banned lead in the\nmanufacture of paint and established disclosure requirements and\nguidelines for testing and remediation.\nChapter 8: Land Use Planning and Control 115",

They are not expected to have expert knowledge\nof environmental law nor of physical conditions in a property. Rather, they\nmust treat potential environmental hazards in the same way that they treat\nother material facts about a property: disclosure.\nIn sum, for their own protection, licensees should be careful to:\n\uf034 be aware of potential hazards\n\uf034 disclose known material facts\n\uf034 distribute the HUD booklet (below)\n\uf034 know where to seek professional help.\nLead. The Lead-based Paint Act of 1992 requires a seller or seller\u2019s agent to\ndisclose known lead problems in properties built before 1978. The licensee\nmust give the buyer or lessee a copy of the EPA-HUD-US Consumer Product\nSafety Commission booklet, \u201cProtect Your Family from Lead in your home.\u201d\nFurther, the 1996 lead-based paint regulation requires sellers or lessors of almost\nall residential properties built before 1978 to disclose known lead-based paint\nhazards and provide any relevant records available. The seller is not required to\ntest for lead but must allow the buyer a ten-day period for lead inspection. Only a\nlicensed lead professional is permitted to deal with testing, removal or\nencapsulation. It is the real estate practitioner\u2019s responsibility to ensure\ncompliance.\nCERCLA/Superfund. Under CERCLA and the Superfund Amendment of 1986,\ncurrent landowners as well as previous owners of a property may be held liable for\nenvironmental violations, even if \u201cinnocent\u201d of a violation. Sellers often carry the\ngreatest exposure, and real estate licensees may be held liable for improper\ndisclosure.\nA real property owner can be held liable for the entire cost of remediating soil,\ngroundwater, or indoor air contamination. A tenant can be held liable for cleanup\ncosts as an \u201coperator\u201d if tenant operations are linked to contamination\nSale of a contaminated property. Selling a property with an environmental\nproblem does not avoid liability for the seller, although seller and buyer may\nagree to share or transfer some liability. If there is a concern, a Phase I audit or\nEnvironmental Site Assessment (ESA) should be conducted before proceeding\nwith the transaction. A Phase I audit identifies\n\uf034 prior uses\n\uf034 presence of hazardous materials\nThe Phase I ESA reviews environmental documents; conducts a title search for\nenvironmental liens and restrictions; and includes a visual inspection of the site\nand surrounding properties. There is no sampling or testing. Fannie Mae,\nFreddie Mac, and HUD require special Phase I ESAs on certain properties.\nA Phase II audit (ESA) is conducted if a site is considered contaminated.
