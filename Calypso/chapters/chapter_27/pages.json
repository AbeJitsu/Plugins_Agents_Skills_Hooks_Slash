Just as when applying for a salesperson license, if the\napplicant has been convicted of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, he\nor she may file an \"Application for Determination of Licensing Eligibility\" form\nwith the Commission. The Commission will review the conviction(s) and\ndetermine if the applicant is eligible for licensure in Alabama.\nAdditionally, the AREC requires both state and national criminal history checks\nto be performed on any applicant for licensure. The applicant must submit any\nrequired information and fingerprints to the Commission, to the Federal Bureau\nof Investigation, to the Alabama State Law Enforcement Agency or its successor,\nor to a fingerprint processing service approved by the Commission. Fingerprints\nare to be submitted on the approved fingerprint card.\nThe AREC may then use the criminal history to determine the qualifications and\nfitness of the applicant to hold a real estate license. The applicant is responsible\nfor the cost of the criminal history check which must be current to the date of\nlicense issuance.\nSalesperson experience. The broker applicant also must have been licensed as\nan active real estate salesperson in any state for at least 24 months before\napplying for a broker license. The 24 months of licensure must have occurred\nwithin the 36 months prior to applying for the Alabama broker license. Proof of\nthis licensure must be submitted to the Commission along with the broker license\napplication.\nCoursework and state examination. Additionally, the broker applicant must\ncomplete a 60-hour AREC-approved broker pre-license real estate course.\nAfter the applicant has met all requirements, he or she must apply to take the\nnational and state broker licensure examination, pay the examination fee, and\npass the examination with a score of at least 70%. The examination must be taken\nand passed within 6 months of course completion.\nWhen the applicant has met all requirements, including passing the examination,\nhe or she will apply for the broker license. Once the broker license is issued, the\nbroker's salesperson's license automatically terminates. The salesperson's license\ncertificate is to be returned to the Commission for the broker's license to be\nissued.\nAn applicant for a broker's license must maintain a place of business.\nAssociate broker status. According to Alabama license law, all brokers must be\nregistered to a real estate business and under the business's qualifying broker.\nOnce registered, the broker becomes an associate broker with that qualifying\nbroker. By definition, an associate broker is any broker other than a qualifying\nbroker, made so by his or her relationship with the qualifying broker.\nChapter 27: Alabama Brokerage Regulation 461",

The other common entity defined as a company\nis a branch office. Alabama license law requires every qualifying broker and\nevery place of business to have a company license.\nLicense application. The company's qualifying broker is responsible for\napplying for a company license or branch office license. The application must be\nmade on an AREC-approved form. Branch office licenses use a special\napplication form because the law requires that the branch qualifying broker and\nthe main company qualifying broker both share responsibility for the actions at\nthe branch office.\nThe qualifying broker is required to be an officer, partner, or employee of the\ncompany.\nThe company license applicant must maintain a place of business. If the applicant\nmaintains more than one place of business in Alabama, he or she needs a\ncompany or branch office license for each location or branch office. The\ncompany must meet the following requirements for licensure:\n\uf034 the application must include the location of the company or branch\noffice and the name of its qualifying broker\n\uf034 each company or branch office must be under the direction and\nsupervision of a qualifying broker who is licensed at the company\nor branch office address\n\uf034 each company or branch office must have its own qualifying broker\nwith no qualifying broker serving more than one location\n\uf034 the branch office qualifying broker and the company qualifying\nbroker are to share equal responsibility for the activities of all\nlicensees assigned to the branch office or company\nEvery activity that requires a real estate license must be performed in the name of\nthe licensed company under the qualifying broker. If the qualifying broker\ndeclines to support certain types of business activities, the salespersons and\nbrokers working for that company must not engage in those activities.\nFor example, let's say that qualifying broker Bob does not want to include\nproperty management in the services offered by his company. Bob has several\nassociate brokers who want to manage property, so they decide to manage\nproperty on their own and not under Bob. Bob has told them he doesn't care as\nlong as he doesn't have to deal with the activities. Bob has also told them that\nthey cannot use the company name when offering and performing the property\nmanagement services.\nThis seems workable for all involved, right? However, it is against Alabama\nlicense law because every activity a licensee performs must be performed in the\nname of the licensed company and under the qualifying broker.

To serve as a qualifying broker, the\nindividual must be an Alabama-licensed broker with real estate being his or her\nprincipal business. The individual must also be in a position to supervise the real\nestate activities of any associate broker or salesperson registered to that office.\nServing as a qualifying broker is a full time position, so the individual must be\navailable to serve full time.\nResponsibilities of\nqualifying broker Salespersons and associate brokers must be licensed under a qualifying broker\nwho is then responsible for real estate activities in which the salesperson or\nassociate broker engage. The qualifying broker is also responsible for all real\nestate activities of the company for which he or she is the qualifying broker.\nThe qualifying broker must also assure that all transactions performed by any\nlicensee or company for which he or she is responsible comply with Alabama\nlicense law and AREC rules.\nIf a licensee or company for which the qualifying broker is responsible violates\nany of these laws or rules, the qualifying broker will be held responsible to the\ninjured party for any damage caused by the violation. The qualifying broker's\nliability will be in addition to the licensee's own liability for such violations.\nThe qualifying broker is also responsible for displaying the current licenses for\nall companies, branch offices, brokers, and salespersons under his or her\nsupervision. The licenses must be publicly displayed at the place of business.\nEven though the law requires the qualifying broker to supervise the associate\nbrokers and salespersons licensed under him or her, the law is not meant to\nestablish an employer-employee relationship. The broker and licensee may\nestablish such a relationship, but the law does not automatically establish it for\nthem.\nBroker supervision One of the primary responsibilities of a qualifying broker is proper supervision of\nthe broker\u2019s company and of those licensed under the broker. Proper supervision\nincludes, but is not limited to, the following:\n1) maintain an active broker\u2019s license with the Commission\n2) prevent unlicensed persons from engaging in activities requiring a license on\nbehalf of the qualifying broker or company\n3) prevent a licensee from conducting licensed activity for a company under\nwhich the licensee is not licensed\n4) prevent a person whose license is expired, inactive, pending transfer\nsuspended, or revoked from engaging in licensed activities\n5) ensure that licensees comply with any restrictions placed on their licenses\n6) refrain from causing licensees to violate a state, federal, or local law or\nregulation while conducting licensed activity\nChapter 27: Alabama Brokerage Regulation 463",

Remember, each licensee\nmust be registered under a qualifying broker. So, if the qualifying broker wants to\ncease being a licensee's qualifying broker, he or she must send the licensee's\nlicense certificate back to the Commission. The Commission will then issue a\nnew license certificate registered to a new qualifying broker. If the license has\nbeen lost or destroyed, the qualifying broker must verify that in writing to the\nCommission.\nAn individual may terminate his or her status as a qualifying broker for a\ncompany by providing written notice to the company or to the qualifying broker\nof the parent company. He or she must also notify the Commission.\nLicensees and companies whose qualifying broker has terminated his or her\nstatus as such may not perform any acts for which a license is required until a\nrelationship with a new qualifying broker has been established and a new active\nlicense has been issued by the Commission.\nQualifying broker\nfor more than one\ncompany Brokers may not serve as the qualifying broker for more than one company or for\na company and him or herself unless the following requirements are met:\n\uf034 the qualifying broker must obtain the written consent of all\ncompanies for which he or she wishes to serve\n\uf034 the qualifying broker must file a copy of the written consent with\nthe commission\n\uf034 all of the companies share the same company address\nThe qualifying broker's licensees may be engaged by one or all of the companies\nfor which the qualifying broker serves.\nTemporary\nqualifying broker Should a company's qualifying broker die or become disabled, the company\nlicense will become invalid.

During that 6 months, the company must designate a\nfully licensed broker as the qualifying broker.\nIf the company does not designate a fully licensed qualifying broker within 6\nmonths of the commission issuing the temporary license, the company license\nand all licenses under the company will be placed on inactive status by the\nCommission after a 2-week notice.\nPlace of business Real estate professionals must maintain a place of business which is identified by\na sign that includes the name of the company as it is licensed with the AREC. If\nexterior signs are allowed, the sign is to be posted outside the office so that it is\nplainly and readily visible to the public.

The account is set up by the brokerage company's qualifying broker at a\nfederally insured banking institution that is located in Alabama. The funds are\nheld until such a time that a specific event, such as a real estate closing, takes\nplace.\nPurpose When a property is being purchased, the buyer provides earnest money to the\nbroker to be held until the purchase closes. These earnest funds are to be\ndeposited into a bank account other than the broker's business or personal\naccount.\nThis trust fund account keeps the client's money separate from the broker's\nmoney. This ensures that any money the client needs to use for the real estate\ntransaction is in a secure account that is accessible only by the client or the\nbroker. As long as the money is held in a trust account in a bank insured by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), each client's funds are insured up\nto $250,000.\nTrust funds defined Alabama license law and AREC rules require a real estate licensee to deposit and\naccount for all funds belonging to or being held for others at all times. These\nfunds include earnest money, security deposits, and all other funds related to a\ncontract for the sale or lease of property or a property management agreement.\nThey are money or other items of value that the broker receives on behalf of an\nindividual (usually the property buyer) to be held for the benefit of others in\nrelation to any acts for which a real estate license is required.\nThe funds may be U.S. currency (cash), checks, notes, other recognized forms of\nmoney, or other items of value. Cash is to be deposited immediately. Checks may\nbe held for a specific length of time before being deposited if the purchase offer\ndesignates the length of time or the event that must occur prior to the check being\ndeposited. If the offer does not state a specific time for the check to be deposited,\nit is to be deposited when the offer becomes a contract.\n466 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Thus, the qualifying broker is the trustee for the account.\nIf a purchase contract involves more than one qualifying broker, any of the\nqualifying brokers involved in the sale may deposit and hold the funds related to\nthe purchase.\nFunds being held in relation to a purchase contract, a lease, or a property\nmanagement agreement are to be deposited and held by the qualifying broker\nwho is providing these services to the property owner. If the services are\nprovided by a secondary or successor broker, the first broker is to provide a\ncomplete accounting of the funds to the successor qualifying broker and is to\ntransfer the funds to the successor broker.\nThe qualifying broker who is currently providing the services to the owner is\nresponsible to the public and to the Commission for the funds. At the request of\nthe Commission, the current qualifying broker must immediately account for any\ntrust funds he or she holds.\nThe qualifying broker is to be a customer of the bank or financial institution\nwhere the trust account is held and is to be one of the persons with authority to\ndeposit and withdraw funds from the account. He or she may write or make\nchecks as necessary on all trust accounts set up on behalf of the company.\nDisbursement of\ntrust funds The qualifying broker holding the trust funds must disburse the funds to the\nappropriate party or parties within 7 days of the consummation of the transaction\nfor which the funds were being held. In other words, when the purchase is\ncompleted and closed, the funds must be disbursed within 7 days of that closing\ndate.\nIf the transaction does not close or there is disagreement regarding who should\nreceive the funds, the qualifying broker must not disburse any of the funds unless\nthere is a court order or until there is a written agreement signed by all parties.\nAlternatively, the broker may deposit the funds with the appropriate court under\nthe rules of interpleader or any other lawful procedure that is applicable.\nThe rules of interpleader remove the qualifying broker from the disbursement\nprocess and make the disagreeing parties litigate the disbursement between\nthemselves. The qualifying broker becomes the stakeholder, and the disagreeing\nparties become the claimants. The stakeholder then would deposit the funds\nunder dispute with the court, and the court would decide who is legally entitled to\nthe funds. Thus, the qualifying broker is released from any liability regarding\ndisbursement of the funds.\nChapter 27: Alabama Brokerage Regulation 467",

The law has\nalso assigned penalties for failing to perform any of these acts. The law requires\nthe licensee to properly account for or remit money belonging to others that\ncomes into his or her possession. Consequently, licensees must be able to\ncorrectly determine the amount of trust funds they are holding. Failure to do so is\na violation of the law. The law also requires the broker to deposit and account for\nall funds belonging to others or being held for others in a federally insured\naccount in a financial institution located in Alabama. Failure to do so is a\nviolation of the law.\nNo commingling. Further, the licensee is required to maintain trust accounts\nseparate from his or her personal or business accounts to hold funds belonging to\nothers. The trust account may hold funds belonging to multiple clients but not\nfunds belonging to the broker. Failure to separate the broker's funds from the\nfunds belonging to others is called commingling and is a violation of Alabama\nlaw. However, the AREC does allow the broker to keep some personal funds in a\ntrust account to cover bank service charges or check fees.\nThe qualifying broker can lose his or her license if the broker uses any money\nfrom the trust account for his own personal or business use.\nThe broker is not only responsible for his or her own actions, but also for the\nactions of the salespersons and brokers which the qualifying broker supervises.\nThus, the qualifying broker may be held responsible for any commingling,\nembezzling, and conversion of his or her client's money committed by associate\nbrokers or salespersons.\nViolations and discipline. If a licensee violates any of these provisions of the\nlaw pertaining to trust funds and the violation is reported in writing to the AREC,\nthe Commission or its staff may investigate the actions and records of the\nlicensee. Just as with any other violation or complaint, the Commission may issue\nsubpoenas and hear testimony of witnesses and require trust fund records and\ndocuments to be produced during the course of the investigation.\nIf the Commission finds probable cause as a result of the investigation, the\nCommission will file a formal complaint and hold a hearing on the complaint. If\nthe hearing determines the licensee is guilty of an alleged trust fund violation, the\nCommission will impose any or all of the following penalties for each act for\nwhich the licensee is found guilty:\n\uf034 require the licensee to complete continuing education courses in\naddition to the existing CE requirements\n\uf034 suspend or revoke the licensee's license\n\uf034 impose a fine of at least $100 but not more than $5,000\n\uf034 suspend or revoke the license and impose a fine\n\uf034 reprimand the licensee\nThe Commission may suspend or revoke the license until the licensee has\ncompleted an approved continuing education course and/or made restitution to\n468 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

However, it is also\nunfortunately common for electronic hackers and scammers to use the same\ntransfer methods to commit email and wire fraud and obtain funds belonging to\nothers.\nThe scammer typically hacks into an email account or impersonates the email of\na party involved in a real estate transaction. Once the scammer has the email of\nthe involved party, the scammer transmits false wiring information for the\ntransfer of funds from the real estate transaction. The funds then are wired to the\nscammer's bank account and then immediately transferred to a bank out of the\ncountry, making it impossible to recover the funds. Typically, neither the\nscammer's bank or the victim's bank will reimburse the funds.\nScammers are targeting licensees, parties to transactions, and even real estate\nsettlement agents in Alabama and across the U.S. The following tips will help\nprotect involved parties from falling victim to these scammers:\n\uf034 never send wire transfer information or any sensitive information\nby email. this includes bank information or routing numbers\n\uf034 include statements in emails that wiring instructions will not be sent\nby email\n\uf034 inform parties involved in the transaction of the scam and ask they\ninform the licensee of any requests involving funds transfers\n\uf034 if funds must be wired, contact the intended recipient on the phone\nand inform them of the intended transfer\n\uf034 do not open suspicious emails or click on suspicious links\n\uf034 be very careful with callers who request username or password\nverification\n\uf034 use passwords that are not easy to guess and then change them on a\nregular basis\n\uf034 keep firewall and antivirus software up to date\nWhile hackers and scammers are becoming more and more sophisticated on ways\nto obtain bank account information, often times simple steps and common sense\ncan thwart their efforts.\nEscrow account\nreconciliation As the trust account holder, the qualifying broker is responsible for depositing\nand accounting for all trust funds in the account.

However, there are numerous costs\nassociated with the closing that can become quite complex. The costs involved\nare determined by the sales contract, local tradition and custom, type of\nfinancing, and local, state, and federal laws.\nThe closing statement. A closing statement is an accounting document used in\nthe real estate transaction closing that details the final costs related to a transfer of\nownership of property. It is also known as a settlement statement.\nWhile the closing statement presents the final settlement costs, buyers and sellers\nneed to know the approximate transaction costs at the time an offer to purchase\nthe property is made. Therefore, the law requires that an estimated closing\nstatement be produced for both the buyer and the seller at the time an offer or\ncounteroffer is made. The estimate approximates settlement costs so that each\nparty will be duly informed and prepared. All parties to the transaction should\ncompare the estimated closing statement to the final closing statement to find and\ncorrect potential errors.\nProviding an estimated closing statement to the buyer and seller also helps\nprotect against mortgage fraud by eliminating the potential for unexpected and/or\nunexplained costs charged by the bank or mortgage company at the actual\nclosing.\nPurpose for\nthe estimate Any licensee who represents a residential buyer and obtains a written purchase\noffer must prepare and provide an estimated closing statement to the buyer. The\nstatement must contain the most accurate and complete estimates of all costs that\nare the buyer's responsibility at the time the transaction closes. The statement\nmust itemize not only which costs the buyer will pay but also the estimated\namount of each cost. The licensee must provide the statement to the buyer at the\ntime the buyer signs the offer to purchase.\nAny licensee who represents a residential seller and presents a written purchase\noffer to such seller must also prepare and provide an estimated closing statement\nto the seller. The statement provided to the seller must show which costs are the\nseller's responsibilities and approximately how much each of those costs will be.\nThis statement is to be provided to the seller at the time the offer is presented.\nBy signing the estimated and the actual closing statements, both the buyer and the\nseller are acknowledging that they received the statements.\nTILA, RESPA and TRID.

TILA-\nRESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) Rules have specific requirements for\ndisclosure notices from the lender of a mortgage loan to the borrower.\nUnder TRID, the Good Faith Estimate formerly provided by lenders has been\nreplaced by the Loan Estimate, which must be provided to the borrower of a\nmortgage loan within 3 business days of the borrower's application for the loan.\nAdditionally, a TRID-mandated Closing Disclosure must be provided to the\nborrower 3 days prior to closing on the mortgage loan.\nKeep in mind the difference in these mandated disclosures:\n\uf034 the estimated closing statement, mandated by Alabama law, is\nprovided by the real estate licensee to inform the buyer and the\nseller of all costs associated to the real estate transaction closing; it\nis provided at the time a purchase offer or counter offer is submitted\n\uf034 the loan estimate and closing disclosure, mandated by federal law,\nare provided by the lender to inform the borrower of the costs\nassociated with the mortgage loan; the loan estimate is provided at\nthe time the loan application is received, and the closing disclosure\nis three days prior to closing, as stated\nBoth federal and state laws work to assure the consumer is informed, prepared,\nand protected in real estate transactions and financing.\nEstimated closing\nexpenditures The estimated closing statement includes debits and credits for both the seller and\nthe buyer that are due at closing and the approximate amount of each. Typically,\nwhat is a debit to the seller is a credit to the buyer and vice versa.\nDebits for the seller would include the following:\n\uf034 real estate commissions to be paid\n\uf034 escrow fees\n\uf034 excise taxes, if applicable\n\uf034 repairs to be done based on the home inspection\n\uf034 prorated property taxes and assessments\n\uf034 title clearing\n\uf034 second mortgages, home equity loans, and tax liens\n\uf034 any other items to be paid by the seller\n\uf034 credits for the seller would include the following:\n\uf034 purchase price of the property\n\uf034 prorated prepaid property insurance\n\uf034 prorated prepaid utilities\n\uf034 prorated prepaid property taxes\n\uf034 any other agreed upon shared costs between the buyer and seller\n472 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The Act requires that the lender disclose\nthe costs of closing to the borrower and prohibits the lender from demanding\nexcessive deposits for escrow accounts.\nProviding an estimated closing statement is the means for disclosing purchasing\nor sellings costs that the buyer or seller will be expected to pay. Because the\nnotification must take place at the time an offer to purchase is obtained from the\nbuyer or presented to the seller, it assures there will be no surprises for either\nparty at closing.\nFailing to disclose these estimated costs to the buyer or the seller is a violation of\nAlabama license law and RESPA and puts the licensee at risk of investigation by\nthe AREC. If found guilty at a formal hearing, the licensee may have his or her\nlicense suspended or revoked, may have a $100 to $5,000 fine imposed, may be\nreprimanded for each instance of a guilty verdict. The licensee may also be\nrequired to complete an approved continuing education course and/or make\nrestitution.\nChapter 27: Alabama Brokerage Regulation 473",

They are prohibited from\nmaking false promises that could potentially influence, persuade, or induce a\nconsumer to enter into a contract. They are also prohibited from flagrant\nmisrepresentation in any form of advertising. Publishing any advertisement that\ndeceives the public or is likely to deceive the public is against the law. All\nadvertisements must identify the advertiser as a licensed broker or salesperson.\nAdvertising with an\ninterest Alabama license law exempts property owners from licensing requirements\nwhen the owners are managing their own property or engaging in a real estate\ntransaction involving their own property. In other words, a property owner can\nmanage, lease, or sell his or her own property without needing to be licensed as a\nreal estate salesperson or broker. This also means the property owner can\nadvertise his or her own property for lease or sale without needing to be licensed.\nAlabama license law also allows any property owner who becomes a licensed\nbroker or salesperson to advertise his or her own property. However, while the\nnon-licensed owner is exempt from the license laws, the licensed owner must\nabide by all provisions of the law and AREC rules in any real estate transaction.\nThis includes transactions in which the licensee is the property owner or the\nspouse, child, or parent of the property owner.\nThus, the licensee must also comply with all applicable laws when advertising his\nor her own property for lease or sale.\nFurther, if the licensee is advertising his or her own property or property\nbelonging to a member of the licensee's immediate family, the licensee must\nprovide prior written disclosure of his or her interest in the property to all parties\nto the transaction. The licensee must also disclose that he or she is a licensed real\nestate salesperson or broker. The law states the disclosure must be \"timely\"\nwithout giving a definitive time frame.\nIf the licensee is seeking to purchase an interest in a property being sold by his or\nher brokerage company, the licensee must disclose his or her intention to the\nproperty seller or the seller's agent. The licensee must inform the seller that he or\nshe is a licensed real estate salesperson or broker and that he or she is the\nintended buyer of the property.\nSignage Real estate licensees have the legal right to advertise property for sale, lease, or\ntransfer using signs that are affixed to or located on the property itself. Alabama\ndoes not allow a municipal corporation or local government to impose a fee or\ntax on the signs, whether the signs are located on or near the property.\nHowever, local, county and city governments are allowed to set and enforce\nreasonable restrictions on the size, height, and placement of signs on private\n474 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The restrictions\ninclude the manner of erection and posting of signs, interference or obstructions\ncaused by the signs, removal and disposal of the signs, etc.\nTeam Advertising Real estate teams have specific advertising rules that apply only to them. While\nthe law has granted AREC the ability to adopt rules regarding the words that may\nand may not be used in team names and how teams may market and advertise\ntheir services, the law does proscribe a few of its own requirements.\nIn team advertisements, the name of at least one team member and the name of\nthe real estate company where the team members are licensed must both be\nincluded in the ad. Either \u201cteam\u201d or \u201cgroup\u201d must be included in the team name.\nIn addition, the qualifying broker must give written authorization to allow the\nteam to include its name in any advertisements.\nRECORDKEEPING\nBoth estimated closing statements and the actual closing statements must be\nretained in the broker's files. The buyer's agent should retain the estimated and\nactual closing statements signed by the buyer in his or her qualifying broker's\nfiles, while the seller's agent retains the statements signed by the seller. Neither\nlicensee is required to retain statements signed by both the buyer and the seller.\nNor is it necessary for cooperating brokers to maintain both the buyer's statement\nand the seller's statement.\nAlthough the law does not specify a time frame for retention of closing\nstatements, as with any documents or records related to a real estate transaction,\nthe statements should be retained for at least 3 years.\nChapter 27: Alabama Brokerage Regulation 475",
