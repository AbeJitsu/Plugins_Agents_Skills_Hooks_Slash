<div>ENCUMBRANCES</div>
<div>An encumbrance is an interest in and right to real property that limits the legal</div>
<div>owner's freehold interest. In effect, an encumbrance is another's right to use or</div>
<div>take possession of a legal owner's property, or to prevent the legal owner from</div>
<div>enjoying the full bundle of rights in the estate.</div>
<div>An encumbrance does not include the right of possession and is therefore a</div>
<div>lesser interest than the owner's freehold interest. For that reason,</div>
<div>encumbrances are not considered estates. However, an encumbrance can lead</div>
<div>to the owner's loss of ownership of the property.</div>
<div>Easements and liens are the most common types of encumbrance. An</div>
<div>easement, such as a utility easement, enables others to use the property,</div>
<div>regardless of the owner's desires. A lien, such as a tax lien, can be placed on</div>
<div>the property's title, thereby restricting the owner's ability to transfer clear title</div>
<div>to another party.</div>
<div>The two general types of encumbrance are those that affect the property's use</div>
<div>and those that affect legal ownership, value and transfer.</div>

<div>EASEMENTS</div>
<div>Easement appurtenant</div>
<div>Easement in gross</div>
<div>Easement creation</div>
<div>Easement termination</div>
<div>An easement is an interest in real property that gives the holder the right to</div>
<div>use portions of the legal owner's real property in a defined way. Easement</div>
<div>rights may apply to a property's surface, subsurface, or airspace, but the</div>
<div>affected area must be defined.</div>
<div>The receiver of the easement right is the benefited party; the giver of the</div>
<div>easement right is the burdened party.</div>
<div>Essential characteristics of easements include the following:</div>
<div> An easement must involve the owner of the land over which</div>
<div>the easement runs, and another, non-owning party. One cannot</div>
<div>own an easement over one's own property.</div>
<div> an easement pertains to a specified physical area within the</div>
<div>property boundaries</div>
<div> an easement may be affirmative, allowing a use, such as a rightof-way, or negative, prohibiting a use, such as an airspace</div>
<div>easement that prohibits one property owner from obstructing</div>
<div>another's ocean view</div>
<div>The two basic types of easement are appurtenant and gross.</div>
<div>Easement</div>
<div>appurtenant An easement appurtenant gives a property owner a right of usage to portions of</div>
<div>an adjoining property owned by another party. The property enjoying the usage</div>
<div>right is called the dominant tenement, or dominant estate. The property</div>
<div>containing the physical easement itself is the servient tenement, since it must</div>
<div>serve the easement use.</div>
<div>Chapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 57</div>
<div>The term appurtenant means "attaching to." An easement appurtenant attaches to</div>
<div>the estate and transfers with it unless specifically stated otherwise in the</div>
<div>transaction documents. More specifically, the easement attaches as a beneficial</div>
<div>interest to the dominant estate, and as an encumbrance to the servient estate. The</div>
<div>easement appurtenant then becomes part of the dominant estate's bundle of</div>
<div>rights and the servient estate's obligation, or encumbrance.</div>
<div>Transfer. Easement appurtenant rights and obligations automatically transfer</div>
<div>with the property upon transfer of either the dominant or servient estate,</div>
<div>whether mentioned in the deed or not. For example, John grants Mary the right</div>
<div>to share his driveway at any time over a five-year period, and the grant is duly</div>
<div>recorded. If Mary sells her property in two years, the easement right transfers to</div>
<div>the buyer as part of the estate.</div>
<div>Non-exclusive use. The servient tenement, as well as the dominant tenement,</div>
<div>may use the easement area, provided the use does not unreasonably obstruct the</div>
<div>dominant use.</div>
<div>Exhibit 5.2 Easements appurtenant</div>
<div>The exhibit shows a conventional easement appurtenant. The driveway marked</div>
<div>A belongs to parcel #2. An easement appurtenant, marked B, allows parcel #3 to</div>
<div>use #2's driveway. Parcel #3 is the dominant tenement, and #2 is the servient</div>
<div>tenement.</div>
<div>Easement by necessity. An easement by necessity is an easement appurtenant</div>
<div>granted by a court of law to a property owner because of a circumstance of</div>
<div>necessity, most commonly the need for access to a property. Since property</div>
<div>cannot be legally landlocked, or without legal access to a public thoroughfare, a</div>
<div>court will grant an owner of a landlocked property an easement by necessity</div>
<div>58 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama</div>
<div>over an adjoining property that has access to a thoroughfare. The landlocked</div>
<div>party becomes the dominant tenement, and the property containing the easement</div>
<div>is the servient tenement.</div>
<div>In the exhibit, parcel #1, which is landlocked, owns an easement by</div>
<div>necessity, marked C, across parcel #2.</div>
<div>Party wall easement. A party wall is a common wall shared by two</div>
<div>separate structures along a property boundary.</div>
<div>Party wall agreements generally provide for severalty ownership of half of the</div>
<div>wall by each owner, or at least some fraction of the width of the wall. In</div>
<div>addition, the agreement grants a negative easement appurtenant to each owner in</div>
<div>the other's wall. This is to prevent unlimited use of the wall, in particular a</div>
<div>destructive use that would jeopardize the adjacent property owner's building.</div>
<div>The agreement also establishes responsibilities and obligations for maintenance</div>
<div>and repair of the wall.</div>
<div>For example, Helen and Troy are adjacent neighbors in an urban housing</div>
<div>complex having party walls on property lines. They both agree that they</div>
<div>separately own the portion of the party wall on their property. They also grant</div>
<div>each other an easement appurtenant in their owned portion of the wall. The</div>
<div>easement restricts any use of the wall that would impair its condition. They also</div>
<div>agree to split any repairs or maintenance evenly.</div>
<div>Other structures that are subject to party agreements are common fences,</div>
<div>driveways, and walkways.</div>
<div>Easement in gross An easement in gross is a personal right that one party grants to another to use</div>
<div>the grantor's real property. The right does not attach to the grantor's estate. It</div>
<div>involves only one property, and, consequently, does not benefit any property</div>
<div>owned by the easement owner. There are no dominant or servient estates in an</div>
<div>easement in gross. An easement in gross may be personal or commercial.</div>
<div>Chapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 59</div>
<div>Exhibit 5.3 Easements in Gross</div>
<div>Personal. A personal easement in gross is granted for the grantee's lifetime. The</div>
<div>right is irrevocable during this period, but terminates on the grantee's death. It</div>
<div>may not be sold, assigned, transferred, or willed. A personal gross easement</div>
<div>differs from a license in that the grantor of a license may revoke the usage right.</div>
<div>The exhibit shows that a beachfront property owner (A) has granted a neighbor</div>
<div>(B) across the street the right to cross A's property to reach the beach.</div>
<div>Commercial. A commercial easement in gross is granted to a business entity</div>
<div>rather than a private party. The duration of the commercial easement is not tied to</div>
<div>anyone's</div>
<div>lifetime. The right may by assigned, transferred, or willed.</div>
<div>Examples of commercial gross easements include:</div>
<div> a marina's right-of-way to a boat ramp</div>
<div> a utility company's right-of-way across a lot owners' property to</div>
<div>install and maintain telephone lines (as illustrated in the exhibit).</div>
<div>Easement creation An easement may be created by voluntary action, by necessary or</div>
<div>prescriptive operation of law, and by government power of eminent</div>
<div>domain.</div>
<div>Voluntary. A property owner may create a voluntary easement by express grant</div>
<div>in a sale contract, or as a reserved right expressed in a deed.</div>
<div>Necessity. A court decree creates an easement by necessity to provide access</div>
<div>to a landlocked property. Easement by prescription. If someone uses</div>
<div>another's property as an easement without permission for a statutory period of</div>
<div>time and under certain conditions, a court order may give the user the easement</div>
<div>right by prescription, regardless of the owner's desires.</div>
<div>60 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama</div>
<div>For a prescriptive easement order to be granted, the following circumstances</div>
<div>must be true:</div>
<div> Adverse and hostile use</div>
<div>the use has been occurring without permission or license</div>
<div> Open and notorious use</div>
<div>the owner knows or is presumed to have known of the use</div>
<div> Continuous use</div>
<div>the use has been generally uninterrupted over the statutory</div>
<div>prescriptive period</div>
<div>For example, a subdivision owns an access road, which is also used by other</div>
<div>neighborhoods to access a grocery store. One day, the subdivision blocks off</div>
<div>the road, claiming it has never granted the neighbors permission to use the</div>
<div>road. If the neighbors have been using the road for the prescribed period, they</div>
<div>may sue for an easement by prescription, since the subdivision owners can be</div>
<div>assumed to have known of the usage.</div>
<div>Eminent domain. Government entities can create easements through the</div>
<div>exercise of eminent domain, wherein they condemn a portion of a property and</div>
<div>cause it to be sold "for the greater good." A typical example is a town's</div>
<div>condemnation of private land to create a new municipal sewer system.</div>
<div>Easement</div>
<div>termination Easements terminate by:</div>
<div> express release of the right by the easement holder</div>
<div> merger, as when a dominant tenement acquires the servient</div>
<div>property, or vice versa</div>
<div> purposeful abandonment by the dominant tenement</div>
<div> condemnation through eminent domain</div>
<div> change or cessation of the purpose for the easement</div>
<div> destruction of an easement structure, such as a party fence</div>
<div> non-use of an easement by prescription</div>
<div>Chapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 61</div>
<div>ENCROACHMENTS</div>
<div>An encroachment is the unauthorized, physical intrusion of one owner's real</div>
<div>property into that of another.</div>
<div>Examples of encroachments are:</div>
<div> a tree limb extending into the neighbor's property, violating his</div>
<div>or her airspace</div>
<div> a driveway extending beyond the lot line onto the neighbor's land</div>
<div> a fence built beyond the property line</div>
<div>Encroachments cause infringements on the rights of the trespassed owner, and</div>
<div>may diminish the property's value, particularly when the property is to be sold.</div>
<div>Encroachments often do not appear on a property's title records. A survey may</div>
<div>be required to detect or demonstrate the existence of an encroachment.</div>
<div>An owner may sue for removal of an encroachment or for compensation for</div>
<div>damages. If an encroached owner takes no remedial action over a prescribed</div>
<div>number of years, the encroachment may become an easement by prescription.</div>
<div>LICENSES</div>
<div>A license, much like a personal easement in gross, is a personal right that a</div>
<div>property owner grants to another to use the property for a specific purpose.</div>
<div>Licenses are not transferrable and do not attach to the land. They cease on the</div>
<div>death of either party, or on the sale of the property.</div>
<div>Unlike a personal easement in gross, a license is revocable at any time. Licenses</div>
<div>are often granted informally, as a verbal statement of permission.</div>
<div>A farmer granting a neighbor permission to cross his land to reach and fish in</div>
<div>his pond is an example of a license.</div>
<div>DEED RESTRICTIONS</div>
<div>A deed restriction is a limitation imposed on a buyer's use of a</div>
<div>property by stipulation in the deed of conveyance or recorded</div>
<div>subdivision plat.</div>
<div>62 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama</div>
<div>A deed restriction may apply to a single property or to an entire subdivision. A</div>
<div>developer may place restrictions on all properties within a recorded subdivision</div>
<div>plat. Subsequent re-sales of properties within the subdivision are thereby subject</div>
<div>to the plat's covenants and conditions.</div>
<div>A private party who wants to control the quality and standards of a property</div>
<div>can establish a deed restriction. Deed restrictions take precedence over</div>
<div>zoning ordinances if they are more restrictive.</div>
<div>Deed restrictions typically apply to:</div>
<div> the land use</div>
<div> the size and type of structures that may be placed on the property</div>
<div> minimum costs of structures</div>
<div> engineering, architectural, and aesthetic standards, such as</div>
<div>setbacks or specific standards of construction</div>
<div>Deed restrictions in a subdivision, for example, might include a minimum size</div>
<div>for the residential structure, setback requirements for the home, and prohibitions</div>
<div>against secondary structures such as sheds or cottages.</div>
<div>Deed restrictions are either covenants or conditions. A condition can only</div>
<div>be created within a transfer of ownership. If a condition is later violated, a</div>
<div>suit can force the owner to forfeit ownership to the previous owner. A</div>
<div>covenant can be created by mutual agreement. If a covenant is breached, an</div>
<div>injunction can force compliance or payment of compensatory damages.</div>
<div>LIENS</div>
<div>Lien types</div>
<div>Lien priority</div>
<div>Superior liens</div>
<div>Junior liens</div>
<div>A lien is a creditor's claim against personal or real property as security for a debt</div>
<div>of the property owner. If the owner defaults, the lien gives the creditor the right</div>
<div>to force the sale of the property to satisfy the debt.</div>
<div>For example, a homeowner borrows $5,000 to pay for a new roof. The lender</div>
<div>funds the loan in exchange for the borrower's promissory note to repay the loan.</div>
<div>At the same time, the lender places a lien on the property for $5,000 as security</div>
<div>for the debt. If the borrower defaults, the lien allows the lender to force the sale</div>
<div>of the house to satisfy the debt.</div>
<div>The example illustrates that a lien is an encumbrance that restricts free and clear</div>
<div>ownership by securing the liened property as collateral for a debt. If the owner</div>
<div>sells the property, the lienholder is entitled to that portion of the sales proceeds</div>
<div>needed to pay off the debt. In addition, a defaulting owner may lose ownership</div>
<div>altogether if the creditor forecloses.</div>
<div>Chapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 63</div>
<div>In addition to restricting the owner's bundle of rights, a recorded lien</div>
<div>effectively reduces the owner's equity in the property to the extent of the lien</div>
<div>amount.</div>
<div>The creditor who places a lien on a property is called the lienor, and the debtor</div>
<div>who owns the property is the lienee.</div>
<div>Liens have the following legal features:</div>
<div> a lien does not convey ownership, with one exception</div>
<div>A lienor generally has an equitable interest in the property, but</div>
<div>not legal ownership. The exception is a mortgage lien on a</div>
<div>property in a title-theory state. In these states, the mortgage</div>
<div>transaction conveys legal title to the lender, who holds it until the</div>
<div>mortgage obligations are satisfied. During the mortgage loan</div>
<div>period, the borrower has equitable title to the property.</div>
<div> a lien attaches to the property</div>
<div>If the property is transferred, the new owner acquires the lien</div>
<div>securing the payment of the debt. In addition, the creditor may</div>
<div>take foreclosure action against the new owner for satisfaction of</div>
<div>the debt.</div>
<div> a property may be subject to multiple liens</div>
<div>There may be numerous liens against a particular property. The</div>
<div>more liens there are recorded against property, the less secure the</div>
<div>collateral is for a creditor, since the total value of all liens may</div>
<div>approach or exceed the total value of the property.</div>
<div> a lien terminates on payment of the debt and</div>
<div>recording of documents</div>
<div>Payment of the debt and recording of the appropriate satisfaction</div>
<div>documents ordinarily terminate a lien. If a default occurs, a suit</div>
<div>for judgment or foreclosure enforces the lien. These actions force</div>
<div>the sale of the property.</div>
<div>Lien types Liens may be voluntary or involuntary, general or specific, and superior or inferior.</div>
<div>Voluntary and involuntary. A property owner may create a voluntary lien to</div>
<div>borrow money or some other asset secured by a mortgage. An involuntary lien</div>
<div>is one that a legal process places against a property regardless of the owner's</div>
<div>desires.</div>
<div>If statutory law imposes an involuntary lien, the lien is a statutory lien. A real</div>
<div>estate tax lien is a common example. If court action imposes an involuntary lien,</div>
<div>64 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama</div>
<div>the lien is an equitable lien. An example is a judgment lien placed on a property</div>
<div>as security for a money judgment.</div>
<div>General and specific. A general lien is one placed against any and all real and</div>
<div>personal property owned by a particular debtor. An example is an inheritance</div>
<div>tax lien placed against all property owned by the heir. A specific lien attaches to</div>
<div>a single item of real or personal property, and does not affect other property</div>
<div>owned by the debtor. A conventional mortgage lien is an example, where the</div>
<div>property is the only asset attached by the lien.</div>
<div>Superior and inferior lien. The category of superior, or senior, liens ranks</div>
<div>above the category of inferior, or junior, liens, meaning that superior liens</div>
<div>receive first payment from the proceeds of a foreclosure. The superior category</div>
<div>includes liens for real estate tax, special assessments, and inheritance tax.</div>
<div>Other liens, including income tax liens, are inferior.</div>
<div>Lien priority Within the superior and inferior categories, a ranking of lien priority determines</div>
<div>the order of the liens' claims on the security underlying the debt. The highest</div>
<div>ranking lien is first to receive proceeds from the foreclosed and liquidated</div>
<div>security. The lien with lowest priority is last in line. The owner receives any sale</div>
<div>proceeds that remain after all lienors receive their due.</div>
<div>Lien priority is of paramount concern to the creditor, since it establishes the</div>
<div>level of risk in recovering loaned assets in the event of default.</div>
<div>Establishment of priority. Two factors primarily determine lien priority:</div>
<div> the lien's categorization as superior or junior</div>
<div> the date of recordation of the lien</div>
<div>Chapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 65</div>
<div>Exhibit 5.4 Priority of Real Estate Liens</div>
<div>Superior liens in rank order</div>
<div>1. Real estate tax liens</div>
<div>2. Special assessment liens</div>
<div>3. Federal estate tax liens</div>
<div>4. State inheritance tax liens</div>
<div>Junior liens: priority by date of recording</div>
<div>Federal income tax liens</div>
<div>State corporate income tax liens</div>
<div>State intangible tax liens</div>
<div>Judgment liens</div>
<div>Mortgage liens</div>
<div>Vendor's liens</div>
<div>Mechanic's liens (by date work was performed)</div>
<div>Broker&rsquo;s liens</div>
<div>All superior liens take precedence over all junior liens regardless of recording</div>
<div>date, since they are considered to be matters of public record not requiring</div>
<div>further constructive notice. Thus, a real estate tax lien (senior) recorded on June</div>
<div>15 has priority over an income tax lien (junior) recorded on June 1.</div>
<div>A junior lien is automatically inferior, or subordinate, to a superior lien.</div>
<div>Among junior liens, date of recording determines priority. The rule is: the</div>
<div>earlier the recording date of the lien, the higher its priority. For example, if a</div>
<div>judgment lien is recorded against a property on Friday, and a mortgage lien is</div>
<div>recorded on the following Tuesday, the judgment lien has priority and must be</div>
<div>satisfied in a foreclosure ahead of the mortgage lien.</div>
<div>The mechanic's lien is an exception to the recording rule. Its priority dates from</div>
<div>the point in time when the work commenced or ended, as state law determines,</div>
<div>rather than from when it was recorded.</div>
<div>The following example illustrates how lien priority works in paying off secured</div>
<div>debts. A homeowner is foreclosed on a second mortgage taken out in 2018 for</div>
<div>$25,000. The first mortgage, taken in 2016, has a balance of $150,000. Unpaid</div>
<div>real estate taxes for the current year are $1,000. There is a $3,000 mechanic's</div>
<div>lien on the property for work performed in 2017. The home sells for $183,000.</div>
<div>66 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama</div>
<div>The proceeds are distributed in the following order:</div>
<div>1. $1,000 real estate taxes</div>
<div>2. $150,000 first mortgage</div>
<div>3. $3,000 mechanic's lien</div>
<div>4. $25,000 second mortgage</div>
<div>5. $4,000 balance to the homeowner</div>
<div>Note the risky position of the second mortgage holder: the property had to sell</div>
<div>for at least $179,000 for the lender to recover the $25,000.</div>
<div>Subordination. A lienor can change the priority of a junior lien by voluntarily</div>
<div>agreeing to subordinate, or lower, the lien's position in the hierarchy. This</div>
<div>change is often necessary when working with a mortgage lender who will not</div>
<div>originate a mortgage loan unless it is senior to all other junior liens on the</div>
<div>property. The lender may require the borrower to obtain agreements from other</div>
<div>lien holders to subordinate their liens to the new mortgage.</div>
<div>For example, interest rates fall from 8% to 6.5% on first mortgages for principal</div>
<div>residences. A homeowner wants to refinance her mortgage, but she also has a</div>
<div>separate home-equity loan on the house. Since the first-mortgage lender will not</div>
<div>accept a lien priority inferior to a home equity loan, the homeowner must</div>
<div>persuade the home equity lender to subordinate the home equity lien to the new</div>
<div>first-mortgage lien.</div>
<div>Superior liens Real estate tax lien. The local legal taxing authority annually places a real</div>
<div>estate tax lien, also called an ad valorem tax lien, against properties as security</div>
<div>for payment of the annual property tax. The amount of a particular lien is based</div>
<div>on the taxed property's assessed value and the local tax rate.</div>
<div>Special assessment lien. Local government entities place assessment liens</div>
<div>against certain properties to ensure payment for local improvement projects</div>
<div>such as new roads, schools, sewers, or libraries. An assessment lien applies only</div>
<div>to properties that are expected to benefit from the municipal improvement.</div>
<div>Federal and state inheritance tax liens. Inheritance tax liens arise from</div>
<div>taxes owed by a decedent's estate. The lien amount is determined through</div>
<div>probate and attaches to both real and personal property.</div>
<div>Junior liens Tax liens. All tax liens other than those for ad valorem, assessment, and estate</div>
<div>tax are junior liens. They include:</div>
<div> federal income tax lien</div>
<div>placed on a taxpayer's real and personal property for failure to</div>
<div>pay income taxes</div>
<div>Chapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 67</div>
<div> state corporate income tax lien</div>
<div>filed against corporate property for failure to pay taxes</div>
<div> state intangible tax lien</div>
<div>filed for non-payment of taxes on intangible property</div>
<div> state corporation franchise tax lien</div>
<div>filed to ensure collection of fees to do business within a state</div>
<div>Judgment lien. A judgment lien attaches to real and personal property as a</div>
<div>result of a money judgment issued by a court in favor of a creditor. The creditor</div>
<div>may obtain a writ of execution to force the sale of attached property and collect</div>
<div>the debt. After paying the debt from the sale proceeds, the debtor may obtain a</div>
<div>satisfaction of judgment to clear the title records on other real property that</div>
<div>remains unsold.</div>
<div>During the course of a lawsuit, the plaintiff creditor may secure a writ of</div>
<div>attachment to prevent the debtor from selling or concealing property. In such a</div>
<div>case, there must be a clear likelihood that the debt is valid and that the defendant</div>
<div>has made attempts to sell or hide property.</div>
<div>Certain properties are exempt from judgment liens, such as homestead property</div>
<div>and joint tenancy estates.</div>
<div>Mortgage and trust deed lien. In lien-theory states, mortgages and trust deeds</div>
<div>secure loans made on real property. In these states, the lender records a lien as</div>
<div>soon as possible after disbursing the funds in order to establish lien priority.</div>
<div>Vendor's lien. A vendor's lien, also called a seller's lien, secures a purchase</div>
<div>money mortgage, a seller's loan to a buyer to finance the sale of a property.</div>
<div>Municipal utility lien. A municipality may place a utility lien against a</div>
<div>resident's real property for failure to pay utility bills.</div>
<div>Mechanic's lien. A mechanic's lien secures the costs of labor, materials, and</div>
<div>supplies incurred in the repair or construction of real property improvements. If</div>
<div>a property owner fails to pay for work performed or materials supplied, a worker</div>
<div>or supplier can file a lien to force the sale of the property and collect the debt.</div>
<div>Any individual who performs approved work may place a mechanic's lien on the</div>
<div>property to the extent of the direct costs incurred. Note that unpaid</div>
<div>subcontractors may record mechanic's liens whether the general contractor has</div>
<div>been paid or not. Thus it is possible for an owner to have to double-pay a bill in</div>
<div>order to eliminate the mechanic's lien if the general contractor neglects to pay</div>
<div>the subcontractors. The mechanic's lienor must enforce the lien within a certain</div>
<div>time period, or the lien expires.</div>
<div>68 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama</div>
<div>In contrast to other junior liens, the priority of a mechanic's lien dates from the</div>
<div>time when the work was begun or completed. For example, a carpenter finishes a</div>
<div>job on May 15. The owner refuses to pay the carpenter in spite of the carpenter's</div>
<div>two-month collection effort. Finally, on August 1, the carpenter places a</div>
<div>mechanic's lien on the property. The effective date of the lien for purposes of</div>
<div>lien priority is May 15, not August 1.</div>
<div>Broker&rsquo;s lien. Many states allow a broker in specified circumstances to file a</div>
<div>broker&rsquo;s lien against a property in a transaction in case the party obligated to pay</div>
<div>the broker a commission refuses to pay. The lien attaches to the real estate</div>
<div>interest owned by the obligated party.</div>

<div>Deed in lieu of foreclosure</div>
<div>Short sale</div>
<div>All liens can be enforced by the sale or other transfer of title of the secured</div>
<div>property, whether by court action, operation of law, or through powers granted in</div>
<div>the original loan agreement. The enforcement proceedings are referred to as</div>
<div>foreclosure.</div>
<div>State law governs the foreclosure process. Broadly, a statutory or court-ordered</div>
<div>sale enforces a general lien, including a judgment lien. A lawsuit or loan</div>
<div>provision authorizing the sale or direct transfer of the attached property enforces</div>
<div>a specific lien, such as a mortgage. Real estate tax liens are enforced through tax</div>
<div>foreclosure sales, or tax sales.</div>

<div> judicial foreclosure</div>
<div> non-judicial foreclosure</div>
<div> strict foreclosure</div>
<div>Chapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 69</div>
<div>Exhibit 5.5 Foreclosure Processes</div>
<div>Judicial foreclosure Judicial foreclosure occurs in states that use a two-party mortgage document</div>
<div>(borrower and lender) that does not contain a "power of sale" provision.</div>
<div>Lacking this provision, a lender must file a foreclosure suit and undertake a</div>
<div>court proceeding to enforce the lien.</div>
<div>Acceleration and filing. If a borrower has failed to meet loan obligations in spite</div>
<div>of proper notice and applicable grace periods, the lender can accelerate the loan,</div>
<div>or declare that the loan balance and all other sums due on the loan are payable</div>
<div>immediately.</div>
<div>If the borrower does not pay off the loan in full, the lender then files a</div>
<div>foreclosure suit, naming the borrower as defendant. The suit asks the court</div>
<div>to:</div>
<div> terminate the defendant's interests in the property</div>
<div> order the property sold publicly to the highest bidder</div>
<div> order the proceeds applied to the debt</div>
<div>Lis Pendens. In the foreclosure suit, a lis pendens gives public notice that the</div>
<div>mortgaged property may soon have a judgment issued against it. This notice</div>
<div>enables other lienholders to join in the suit against the defendant.</div>
<div>Writ of execution. If the defendant fails to meet the demands of the suit during</div>
<div>a prescribed period, the court orders the termination of interests of any and all</div>
<div>parties in the property, and orders the property to be sold. The court's writ of</div>
<div>execution authorizes an official, such as the county sheriff, to seize and sell the</div>
<div>foreclosed property.</div>
<div>Public sale and sale proceeds. After public notice of the sale, the property is</div>
<div>auctioned to the highest bidder. The new owner receives title free and clear of</div>
<div>all previous liens, whether the lienholders have been paid or not. Proceeds of</div>
<div>the sale are applied to payment of liens according to priority. After payment of</div>
<div>70 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama</div>
<div>real estate taxes, lienholders' claims and costs of the sale, any remaining funds</div>
<div>go to the mortgagor (borrower).</div>
<div>Deficiency judgment. If the sale does not yield sufficient funds to cover the</div>
<div>amounts owed, the mortgagee may ask the court for a deficiency judgment.</div>
<div>This enables the lender to attach and foreclose a judgment lien on other real or</div>
<div>personal property the borrower owns.</div>
<div>Right of redemption. The borrower's right of redemption, also called equity of</div>
<div>redemption, is the right to reclaim a property that has been foreclosed by paying</div>
<div>off amounts owed to creditors, including interest and costs. Redemption is</div>
<div>possible within a redemption period. Some states allow redemption during the</div>
<div>foreclosure proceeding at any time "until the gavel drops" at the sale. Other states</div>
<div>have statutory periods of up to a year following the sale for the owner of a</div>
<div>foreclosed property to redeem the estate. Also see right to reinstate on page 255</div>
<div>in Chapter 17.</div>
<div>Non-judicial</div>
<div>foreclosure When there is a "power of sale" provision in the mortgage or trust deed</div>
<div>document, a non-judicial foreclosure can force the sale of the liened property</div>
<div>without a foreclosure suit. The "power of sale" clause in effect enables the</div>
<div>mortgagee to order a public sale without court decree.</div>
<div>Foreclosure process. On default, the foreclosing mortgagee records and</div>
<div>delivers notice to the borrower and other lienholders. After the proper period, a</div>
<div>"notice of sale" is published, the sale is conducted, and all liens are</div>
<div>extinguished. The highest bidder then receives unencumbered title to the</div>
<div>property.</div>
<div>Deficiency suit. The lender does not obtain a deficiency judgment or lien in a</div>
<div>non-judicial foreclosure action. The lender instead must file a new deficiency</div>
<div>suit against the borrower.</div>
<div>Re-instatement and redemption. During the notice of default and notice of</div>
<div>sale periods, the borrower may pay the lender and terminate the proceedings.</div>
<div>Exact re-instatement periods vary from state to state. There is no redemption</div>
<div>right in non-judicial foreclosure.</div>
<div>Strict foreclosure Strict foreclosure is a court proceeding that gives the lender title directly, by</div>
<div>court order, instead of giving cash proceeds from a public sale.</div>
<div>On default, the lender gives the borrower official notice. After a prescribed</div>
<div>period, the lender files suit in court, whereupon the court establishes a period</div>
<div>within which the defaulting party must repay the amounts owed. If the defaulter</div>
<div>does not repay the funds, the court orders transfer of full, legal title to the</div>
<div>lender.</div>
<div>Deed in lieu of</div>
<div>foreclosure A defaulting borrower who faces foreclosure may avoid court actions and costs</div>
<div>by voluntarily deeding the property to the mortgagee. This is accomplished with</div>
<div>a deed in lieu of foreclosure , which transfers legal title to the lienholder. The</div>
<div>transfer, however, does not terminate any existing liens on the property.</div>
<div>Chapter 5: Encumbrances and Liens 71</div>
<div>Short sale A short sale occurs when a property owner owes more than resale value and loan</div>
<div>pay-off for a property and agrees to let the lender sell the property in exchange</div>
<div>for release from the lien. The lender may or may not agree to accept the deficient</div>
<div>price as satisfaction and may require the seller to pay the deficiency by way of a</div>
<div>deficiency judgment. There may also be tax consequences for the seller. To</div>
<div>avoid the deficiency, the seller must make sure that the agreements include a full</div>
<div>release of the underlying debt and a statement that it was fully satisfied.</div>
<div>After the property is retaken by foreclosure or short sale, it becomes &ldquo;bank</div>
<div>owned.&rdquo; Forbearance or a loan modification allows the borrower to avoid</div>
<div>legal action and keep the property under a new agreement with the lender.</div>
<div>The parties to a short sale are the buyer and seller. The lender is a third party</div>
<div>contingency who must approve the sale. The process is generally as follows.</div>
<div>Short sale procedure</div>
<div>1. The borrower or borrower&rsquo;s agents contact the lender to discuss the short</div>
<div>sale option.</div>
<div>2. If willing, the lender sets the required terms of the short sale.</div>
<div>3. The real estate agent provides the lender a Broker&rsquo;s Price Opinion (BPO).</div>
<div>4. The agent lists the property for sale at the price that will cover the</div>
<div>mortgage.</div>
<div>5. The agent places a note in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) stating that</div>
<div>the lender will consider a short sale.</div>
<div>6. A buyer submits an offer.</div>
<div>7. The owner agrees to the contract</div>
<div>8. The lender approves the short sale.</div>
<div>9. The transaction closes.</div>
<div>10. The lender may take action to recover the deficiency.</div>
