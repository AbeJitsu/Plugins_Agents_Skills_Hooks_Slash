The primary distinction is between ownership by a single party, and\nownership by multiple parties. Various trust structures enable an owner to\nemploy a trustee to hold and manage an estate. Condominiums, cooperatives\nand time-shares are hybrids that combine several forms of ownership.\nSOLE OWNERSHIP\nTenancy in severalty\nTenancy in severalty If a single party owns the fee or life estate, the ownership is a tenancy in\nseveralty. Synonyms are sole ownership, ownership in severalty, and estate in\nseveralty. When the would-be sole owner is a husband or wife, state laws may\nrequire homestead, dower or elective share rights to be released to allow\nownership free and clear of any marriage-related claims.\nThe estate of a deceased tenant in severalty passes to heirs by probate.\nCO-OWNERSHIP\nTenancy in common\nJoint tenancy\nTenancy by the entireties\nCommunity property\nTenancy in partnership\nIf more than one person, or a legal entity such as a corporation, owns an estate in\nland, the estate is held in some form of co-ownership. Co-owners are also called\ncotenants.\nChapter 4: Ownership 39",

The defining\ncharacteristics are:\n\uf034 two or more owners\n\uf034 identical rights\n\uf034 interests individually owned\n\uf034 electable ownership shares\n\uf034 no survivorship\n\uf034 no unity of time\nTwo or more owners. Any number of people may be co-tenants in a\nsingle property.\nIdentical rights. Co-tenants share an indivisible interest in the estate, i.e., all\nhave equal rights to possess and use the property subject to the rights of the other\ncotenants. No co-tenant may claim to own any physical portion of the property\nexclusively. They share what is called undivided possession or unity of\npossession.\nInterests individually owned. All tenants in common have distinct and\nseparable ownership of their respective interests. Co-tenants may sell,\nencumber, or transfer their interests without obstruction or consent from the\nother owners. ( A co-tenant may not, however, encumber the entire property.)\nElectable ownership shares. Tenants in common determine among\nthemselves what share of the estate each party will own. For example, three\nco-tenants may own 40%, 35%, and 25% interests in a property, respectively.\nIn the absence of stated ownership shares, it is assumed that each has a share\nequal to that of the others.\nNo survivorship. A deceased co-tenant's estate passes by probate to the\ndecedent's heirs and devisees rather than to the other tenants in common. Any\nnumber of heirs can share in the ownership of the willed tenancy.\nNo unity of time. It is not necessary for tenants in common to acquire their\ninterests at the same time. A new co-tenant may enter into a pre-existing tenancy\nin common.\nThe following exhibit illustrates how tenants in common may transfer\nownership interests to other parties by sale or will.\n40 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

C decides to sell 4/5 of his interest to D and\n1/5 to E. D's interest in the estate will be 40% (4/5 times 50%), and E's will be\n10% (1/5 times 50%). Both new tenants are tenants in common with A and B.\nNote that any owner may sell any portion of his or her interest to other owners or\noutside parties.\nThe second part of the exhibit shows how, when co-owner A dies, she might\nbequeath her 20% share of the ownership to heirs D and E equally. In such a\ncase, the heirs would each acquire a 10% share of ownership as tenants in\ncommon with B and C.\nJoint tenancy In a joint tenancy, two or more persons collectively own a property as if they\nwere a single person. Rights and interests are indivisible and equal: each has a\nshared interest in the whole property which cannot be divided up. Joint tenants\nmay only convey their interests to outside parties as tenant-in-common interests.\nOne cannot convey a joint tenant interest.\nThe defining characteristics and requirements of joint tenancy are:\n\uf034 unity of ownership\n\uf034 equal ownership\n\uf034 transfer of interest\n\uf034 survivorship\nChapter 4: Ownership 41",

Joint tenants own equal shares in the property, without\nexception. If there are four co-tenants, each owns 25% of the property. If there\nare ten co-tenants, each owns 10%.\nTransfer of interest. A joint tenant may transfer his or her interest in the\nproperty to an outside party, but only as a tenancy in common interest. Whoever\nacquires the interest co-owns the property as a tenant in common with the other\njoint tenants. The remaining joint tenants continue to own an undivided interest\nin the property, less the new cotenant's share.\nSurvivorship. In most states, joint tenants enjoy rights of survivorship: if a joint\ntenant dies, all interests and rights pass to the surviving joint tenants free from\nany claims of creditors or heirs.\nIn other states, joint tenancy does not inherently include survivorship;\nsurvivorship must be expressly stated to be effected on transfer.\nWhen only one joint tenant survives, the survivor's interest becomes an estate in\nseveralty, and the joint tenancy is terminated. The estate will be then probated\nupon the severalty owner's death.\nThe survivorship feature of joint tenancy presents an advantage to tenancy in\ncommon, in that interests pass without probate proceedings. On the other hand,\njoint tenants relinquish any ability to will their interest to parties outside of the\ntenancy.\nExhibit 4.2 Joint Tenancy\n42 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

If B then dies, A acquires the whole estate and becomes the sole\nowner. This event terminates the joint tenancy estate, and it becomes an estate in\nseveralty.\nCreation of joint tenancy. To create a joint tenancy, all owners must acquire\nthe property at the same time, use the same deed, acquire equal interests, and\nshare in equal rights of possession.

Otherwise, and in the absence of clear intent of the parties, the\nestate will be considered a tenancy in common. In addition, a joint tenancy can\nonly be created by agreement between parties, and not by operation of law.\nIn some states, a severalty owner may create a joint tenancy with other parties\nwithout the presence of the four unities by deeding the property to himself or\nherself and other parties as joint tenants.\nTermination by partition suit. A partition suit can terminate a joint tenancy\nor a tenancy in common. Foreclosure and bankruptcy can also terminate these\nestates.\nA partition suit is a legal avenue for an owner who wants to dispose of his or her\ninterest against the wishes of other co-owners.

In owning stock and a lease, a co-op unit owner's interest\nis personal property that is subject to control by the corporation. Unlike\ncondominium ownership, the co-op owner owns neither a unit nor an undivided\ninterest in the common elements.\nProprietary lease. The co-op lease is called a proprietary lease because the\ntenant is an owner (proprietor) of the corporation that owns the property. The\nlease has no stated or fixed rent. Instead, the proprietor-tenant is responsible for\nthe unit's pro rata share of the corporation's expenses in supporting the\ncooperative. Unit owners pay monthly assessments. The proprietary lease has no\nstated term and remains in effect over the owner's period of ownership. When\nthe unit is sold, the lease is assigned to the new owner.\nExpense liability. The failure of individual shareholders to pay monthly\nexpense assessments can destroy the investment of all the other co-op owners\nif the co-op cannot pay the bills by other means.\nSince the corporation owns an undivided interest in the property, debts and\nfinancial obligations apply to the property as a whole, not to individual units.\nShould the corporation fail to meet its obligations, creditors and mortgagees may\nforeclose on the entire property. A completed foreclosure would terminate the\nshareholders' proprietary lease, and bankrupt the owning corporation. Compare\nthis situation with that of a condominium, in which an individual's failure to pay\nendangers only that individual's unit, not the entire property.\nTransfers. The co-op interest is transferred by assigning both the stock\ncertificates and lease to the buyer.\nOrganization and\nmanagement A developer creates a cooperative by forming the cooperative association, which\nsubsequently buys the cooperative property. The association's articles of\nincorporation, bylaws, and other legal documents establish operating policies,\nrules, and restrictions.\nThe shareholders elect a board of directors. The board assumes the responsibility\nfor maintaining and operating the cooperative, much like a condominium board.\nCooperative associations, however, also control the use and ownership of\nindividual apartment units, since they are the legal owners.

    "text": "TIME-SHARES\nTime-share lease\nTime-share freehold\nRegulation\nTime-share ownership is a fee or leasehold interest in a property whose owners\nor tenants agree to use the property on a periodic, non-overlapping basis. This\ntype of ownership commonly concerns vacation and resort properties. Time-\nshare arrangements provide for equal sharing of the property's expenses among\nthe owners.\nTime-share lease In a leasehold time-share, the tenant agrees to rent the property on a scheduled\nbasis or under any pre-arranged system of reservation, according to the terms of\nthe lease. Generally, the scheduled use is denominated in weeks or months over\nthe duration of the lease, a specified number of years.\nTime-share freehold In a freehold time-share, or interval ownership estate, tenants in common own\nundivided interests in the property. Expense prorations and rules governing\ninterval usage are established by separate agreement when the estate is\nacquired.\nFor instance, the Blackburns want a monthly vacation in Colorado once a\nyear. They find a time-share condominium that needs a twelfth buyer. The\navailable month is May, which suits the Blackburns. The total price of the\ncondominium is $240,000, and annual expenses are estimated to be $9,600.\nThe Blackburns buy a one-twelfth interest with the other tenants in common\nby paying their share of the price, $20,000. They are also obligated to pay\none-twelfth of the expenses every year, or $800. They have use of the\nproperty for one-twelfth of the year, in the month of May.\nInterval owners must usually waive the right of partition, which would enable\nan owner to force the sale of the entire property.\nRegulation The development and sale of time-share properties has come under increased\nregulation in recent years. Developers and brokers in many states face more\nstringent disclosure requirements regarding ownership costs and risks. Other\nlaws provide for a cooling-off period after the signing of a time-share sales\ncontract, and require registration of advertising.\nChapter 4: Ownership 53",
