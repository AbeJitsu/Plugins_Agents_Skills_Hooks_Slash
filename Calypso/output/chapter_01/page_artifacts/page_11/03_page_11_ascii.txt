│                        commonly choose to specialize in a property type.     │

│                        markets. Therefore, one must create an area of        │
│                        geographical specialization. One's area may be        │
│                        defined by natural barriers; by streets and highways; │
│                        or by a certain set of subdivisions.                  │

│                        Type of transaction. The principal types of           │
│                        transaction are sales, leases and subleases,          │
│                        exchanges, and options.                               │

│                        Each form of transaction involves particular legal    │
│                        documents and considerations. As a result, many       │
│                        agents, particularly commercial agents, specialize in │
│                        a type of transaction. For example, in an urban       │
│                        commercial property market, agents generally          │
│                        specialize in either leases or sales.                 │

│                        Type of client. Brokers increasingly represent buyers │
│                        and tenants as well as sellers and landlords. Since   │
│                        conflicts of interest may be involved, many brokers   │
│                        restrict their business to representing either buyers │
│                        and tenants or sellers and landlords exclusively.     │

│                        Some brokers and agents also specialize according to  │
│                        the type of business their clients are in or their    │
│                        motivations for the transaction. Thus one finds       │
│                        brokers who focus exclusively on hospitals, or fast   │
│                        food chains, or executive relocations.                │

│                        commission-compensated services. In the advisory      │
│                        relationship, the broker works on identified real     │
│                        estate tasks or projects in exchange for a fee,       │
│                        salary, or retainer. The fee advisor may or may not   │
│                        focus on completing a transaction.                    │
