    <h1 class="section-heading">REGULATION AND LICENSING</h1>

    <h2 class="subsection-heading">Regulation of business practices</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">The real estate industry is regulated by every level of government. Federal and state statutes, as well as a large body of court decisions, generally referred to as common law, circumscribe how real estate can be developed, managed, and transferred.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Among the laws most relevant to agents and brokers are those relating to:</p>

    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li class="bullet-item">agency</li>
        <li class="bullet-item">contracts</li>
        <li class="bullet-item">disclosure</li>
        <li class="bullet-item">environmental impact</li>
        <li class="bullet-item">fair housing</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="paragraph">In addition to federal, state, and local laws and regulations, the real estate industry is, to a degree, self-regulated by the codes of ethical conduct propounded by the industry's many trade organizations. For example, the National Association of Realtors® Code of Ethics not only reflects the law but sets an even higher standard of performance for member brokers and agents.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">It is imperative for new practitioners to understand and abide by the many laws which regulate the industry.</p>

    <h2 class="subsection-heading">Real estate license laws</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">State real estate license laws comprise the primary body of laws and regulations governing real estate brokerage practice. License laws in each state specify who must obtain a license to practice real estate and set the requirements for obtaining and maintaining the license. License laws also define critical aspects of real estate brokerage, including</p>

    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li class="bullet-item">procedures for handling escrow deposits and fees</li>
        <li class="bullet-item">procedures for advertising</li>
        <li class="bullet-item">guidelines for dealing with clients and customers</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="paragraph">State license laws are administered in each state by a <strong>real estate commission</strong>. The commission is charged with administering and enforcing license laws. In addition, the commission may pass regulations that further refine or clarify state statutes.</p>
