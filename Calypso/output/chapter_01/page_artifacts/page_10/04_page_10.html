        <div class="exhibit-box">
            <div class="column">
                <p>residential<br>residential income<br>office<br>retail</p>

    <p class="paragraph">These categories are not absolute, since properties often have overlapping uses. A bank, for example, may have retail as well as office operations. An industrial distribution facility may include extensive office space. A retail center may contain offices.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Special purpose properties include publicly or privately owned recreational facilities, government buildings, churches and schools, and so on.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Most newly licensed practitioners choose to begin their real estate careers in residential brokerage.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Primary real estate brokerage activities involve performance of one or more of the following tasks:</p>

    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li class="bullet-item">locating a buyer for a seller</li>
        <li class="bullet-item">locating a seller for a buyer</li>
        <li class="bullet-item">locating a tenant for a landlord</li>
        <li class="bullet-item">locating a landlord for a tenant</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="paragraph">A seller, buyer, landlord or tenant hires a broker to procure the opposite party to the sale or lease transaction. To help get the job done, the broker hires licensed agents as assistants. The brokerage company, in its simplest form, consists of a broker and the broker's agents, who together work to locate buyers, sellers, tenants and landlords for the broker's clients.</p>
