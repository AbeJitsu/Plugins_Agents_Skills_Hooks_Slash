Within it one might include the construction industry, itself\noften considered our country's largest business. In addition, the real estate\nindustry may be said to include the creation, management, and demolition of\nevery residence and business facility in the nation: offices, warehouses, factories,\nstores, and special purpose buildings such as hospitals and government facilities.\nThe real estate business would include as well the managing of all the\nundeveloped land in the country: national parks, forests, and the vast quantity of\nunused federal property.\nReal estate professionals are individuals and business organizations whose sole\nenterprise is performing a real estate-related service or function. A wide range\nof professions is available to persons wishing to enter the real estate business.\nReal estate\nactivities Real estate professionals perform the following property-related functions:\n\uf034 creation and improvement\n\uf034 management and maintenance\n\uf034 demolition\n\uf034 investment ownership\n\uf034 regulation\n\uf034 transfer\nCreation and improvement. Creating real properties from raw land involves\ncapital formation, financing, construction contracting, and regulatory approvals.\nThe key parties involved in this aspect of the business are generally the\ndeveloper, the landowner, and the mortgage lender. Also involved are market\nanalysts, architects, engineers, space planners, interior designers, and\nconstruction subcontractors.\nChapter 1: The Real Estate Business 7",

The brokerage community, with the assistance\nof professional appraisers, usually handles the ownership and leasing\ntransactions that occur over the many phases of development.\nManagement and maintenance. All real estate, whether raw land or improved\nproperty, must be managed and maintained. The two principal types of\nmanagers are property managers and asset managers. Property managers and\ntheir staff oversee specific properties on behalf of the owners, making sure the\ncondition of the property and its financial performance meet specific standards.\nAsset managers oversee groups of properties, or portfolios. Their role is to\nachieve the investment objectives of the owners as opposed to managing day-\nto-day operations.\nMaintenance personnel include engineers, systems technicians, janitorial staff,\nand other employees needed to maintain the property's condition.\nDemolition. Demolition experts in conjunction with excavation and debris\nremoval experts serve to remove properties that are no longer economically\nviable from the market.\nInvestment ownership. A specialized niche in the real estate business is the\nreal estate investor who risks capital in order to buy, hold, and sell real\nproperties. In contrast to property owners whose primary interest is in some\nother business, the real estate investor focuses on identifying and exploiting real\nestate investment opportunities for profit. The real estate investor provides\ncapital and liquidity to the real estate market.\nRegulation. All real estate is to some degree regulated by government. The\nprincipal areas of regulation are usage, taxation, and housing administration.\nProfessional regulatory functions include public planners, zoning\nadministrators, building inspectors, assessors, and administrators of specific\nfederal statutes such as Federal Fair Housing Laws.\nTransfer. Rights and interests in real estate can be bought, sold, assigned,\nleased, exchanged, inherited, or otherwise transferred from one owner to\nanother. Real estate brokers and the brokers' salespeople are generally centrally\ninvolved in such transfers. Other professional participants are mortgage brokers,\nmortgage bankers, appraisers, insurers, and title companies.\n8 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

According to the purpose of ownership,\nproperties are classified as residential, commercial, or investment properties.\nResidential property refers to property that is owned and used for habitation.\nSuch properties may be further classified in terms of how many families they are\ndesigned to house, whether they are attached to other units or detached, and so\nforth.\nCommercial property generally refers to retail and office properties, but may\nalso include industrial real estate. The term \"commercial\" relates to the fact that\nthe property can potentially generate income from a business's usage.\nInvestment property refers to any property that is held by its owners for\ninvestment purposes. All classifications of property may be investment\nproperties. Generally, however, the term does not refer to owner-occupied\nresidences, even though such properties constitute an investment. Apartments,\ncondominiums, cooperatives, and single-family homes may be considered as\ninvestment property if non-occupants own the property for investment purposes.\nThese properties are also referred to as residential income properties.\nChapter 1: The Real Estate Business 9",

To help get the job done, the broker hires licensed\nagents as assistants. The brokerage company, in its simplest form, consists of a\nbroker and the broker's agents, who together work to locate buyers, sellers,\ntenants and landlords for the broker's clients.\n10 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Forms of\nspecialization In the modern brokerage environment, brokers and agents specialize along the\nfollowing lines:\n\uf034 property type\n\uf034 geographical area\n\uf034 type of transaction\n\uf034 type of client\n\uf034 type of relationship\nOne's choice of specialization is influenced by competitive factors in the market\nand by perceived opportunities.\nProperty type. Since different properties have different features and potential\nbuyers, brokers commonly choose to specialize in a property type. Thus there\nare:\n\uf034 residential agents\n\uf034 commercial agents (office, retail)\n\uf034 industrial agents\n\uf034 land agents\nGeographical area. Brokers and agents must maintain current, accurate data\non properties. It is not possible to keep track of every property in larger\nmarkets. Therefore, one must create an area of geographical specialization.\nOne's area may be defined by natural barriers; by streets and highways; or by a\ncertain set of subdivisions.\nType of transaction. The principal types of transaction are sales, leases\nand subleases, exchanges, and options.\nEach form of transaction involves particular legal documents and considerations.\nAs a result, many agents, particularly commercial agents, specialize in a type of\ntransaction. For example, in an urban commercial property market, agents\ngenerally specialize in either leases or sales.\nType of client. Brokers increasingly represent buyers and tenants as well as\nsellers and landlords. Since conflicts of interest may be involved, many brokers\nrestrict their business to representing either buyers and tenants or sellers and\nlandlords exclusively.\nSome brokers and agents also specialize according to the type of business\ntheir clients are in or their motivations for the transaction. Thus one finds\nbrokers who focus exclusively on hospitals, or fast food chains, or executive\nrelocations.\nType of relationship. In recent years, many brokers have specialized in\nproviding advisory services to clients instead of the traditional transaction-based,\ncommission-compensated services. In the advisory relationship, the broker works\non identified real estate tasks or projects in exchange for a fee, salary, or retainer.\nThe fee advisor may or may not focus on completing a transaction.\nChapter 1: The Real Estate Business 11",

    "text": "REGULATION AND LICENSING\nRegulation of business practices\nReal estate license laws\nRegulation of\nbusiness practices The real estate industry is regulated by every level of government. Federal and\nstate statutes, as well as a large body of court decisions, generally referred to as\ncommon law, circumscribe how real estate can be developed, managed, and\ntransferred.\nAmong the laws most relevant to agents and brokers are those relating to:\n\uf034 agency\n\uf034 contracts\n\uf034 disclosure\n\uf034 environmental impact\n\uf034 fair housing\nIn addition to federal, state, and local laws and regulations, the real estate\nindustry is, to a degree, self-regulated by the codes of ethical conduct\npropounded by the industry's many trade organizations. For example, the\nNational Association of Realtors\u00ae Code of Ethics not only reflects the law but\nsets an even higher standard of performance for member brokers and agents.\nIt is imperative for new practitioners to understand and abide by the many laws\nwhich regulate the industry.\nReal estate\nlicense laws State real estate license laws comprise the primary body of laws and regulations\ngoverning real estate brokerage practice. License laws in each state specify who\nmust obtain a license to practice real estate and set the requirements for\nobtaining and maintaining the license. License laws also define critical aspects\nof real estate brokerage, including\n\uf034 procedures for handling escrow deposits and fees\n\uf034 procedures for advertising\n\uf034 guidelines for dealing with clients and customers\nState license laws are administered in each state by a real estate commission.\nThe commission is charged with administering and enforcing license laws.
