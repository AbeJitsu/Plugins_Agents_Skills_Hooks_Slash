The\nlicense must also be on active status to perform such activity.\nCompensation includes fees, commissions, or other valuable consideration\nreceived from another person in exchange for performing certain activities.\nPerforming licensed activities with the intention or expectation of receiving\ncompensation is considered the same as actually receiving compensation for\npurposes of defining whether a license is required.\nEngaging in the practice of real estate includes:\n\uf034 offering or selling, exchanging, purchasing, renting, or leasing real\nestate located in Alabama\n\uf034 negotiating the listing, sale, exchange, purchase, rental, or leasing\nof real estate located in Alabama\n\uf034 listing for sale, rental, lease, exchange, or trade any real estate\nlocated in Alabama\n\uf034 auctioning any real estate located in Alabama\n\uf034 optioning real estate located in Alabama\n\uf034 locating for purchase, rent, or lease any real estate located in\nAlabama\n442 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The temporary\nlicense is valid for 1 year.\nPost-license education. During the 12 months of temporary licensure, the\nsalesperson must complete a 30-hour post-license course, apply for an original\nsalesperson license, and pay all associated application fees. The salesperson\nshould complete the post-license course and apply for the original license within\nthe first 6 months of temporary licensure. If the salesperson does not complete\nthe course within the first 6 months, the license will automatically be placed on\ninactive status. The salesperson then has the remaining 6 months to complete the\ncourse and apply for an original license. If the salesperson fails to complete the\npost-license course within 12 months, the temporary license will automatically\nexpire and lapse. Temporary licenses may not be renewed.\nHolding a temporary license is required for enrollment in the post-license\ncourse. As with the pre-license course, a 90% attendance rate is required in live\ninstruction courses.\nOriginal licensure Application process. After completing the post-license course, salespersons\nholding a temporary license must apply for an original license on or before the\ndate the temporary license expires.\nThe salesperson must submit the original license application, appropriate fees,\nand proof of completion of the post-license course to the Alabama Real Estate\nCommission on or before midnight on the last day of the month 1 year from the\nissuance of the temporary license.\nFor example, if Joe was issued a temporary license on April 4, 2027, he must\napply for his original license by midnight on April 30, 2028. Joe must also have\ncompleted the post-license course and paid the license fee prior to that date and\ntime.

Therefore,\nusing the above example, if Joe paid the Recovery Fund fee when he applied for\nhis temporary license, he is not required to pay it again when he applies for his\noriginal license.\nLicense renewal All licenses, including inactive licenses, must be renewed to remain current. A\nlicense may be renewed by filing an AREC license renewal form or by utilizing\nthe renewal option available at www.arec.alabama.gov. The licensee must also\npay a renewal fee and complete continuing education courses prior to renewal.\nIf the licensee is on active status, the Commission will mail the renewal form to\nthe licensee's place of business. If the licensee is on inactive status, the form will\nbe mailed to the licensee's residence. The Commission will mail the form prior to\nAugust 1 of the final year of the license period. If the licensee does not receive\nthe form by August 1, he or she must notify the AREC by August 10. The form\nmay only be used for license renewal and not for any other reason, such as a\nlicense transfer.\nRenewal dates. The license period is 2 years, ending in even numbered years.\nThe license will expire at midnight on September 30 of the final year of the 2-\nyear license period. Renewals and renewal fees are due by August 31 of the final\nyear of the license period. Licenses renewed between September 1 and\nSeptember 30 will be charged a late renewal penalty in addition to the renewal\nfee. Licenses not renewed by September 30 will expire and be placed on inactive\nstatus on October 1.\nBecause the license period always ends in an even numbered year, the license\nmust be renewed in the next even numbered year, regardless of when it was\nissued. For example, if the license was issued in April 2025, it would need to be\nrenewed in 2026, the next even numbered year. Similarly, if a license was\noriginally issued in April 2026, the license would need to be renewed that same\nyear because 2026 is an even numbered year.\nExpired licenses may still be renewed during the 12 months following the\nexpiration date. If the license is not renewed during this 12-month period, the\nlicense will lapse. The individual will then need to meet all the same\nrequirements of licensure applicable to individuals who have never been licensed\nand reapply for licensure.\nBy not renewing the license by the September 30 deadline and then by allowing\nthe license to lapse after the 12-month renewal period, the individual will no\nlonger be considered a licensee and will no longer receive correspondence from\nthe AREC.\nUnder certain circumstances, the Commission may determine the existence of a\nhardship for the licensee and allow an extended renewal date with payment of\nrenewal fees and penalties.\nIn addition to submitting the license renewal form and renewal fees, as well as\nrenewal penalties if applicable, the licensee must submit proof of completion of\napproved continuing education courses.\n448 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "A license is inactive when\n\uf034 being held by the AREC as a result of a legal action, an order of the\nCommission, or at the request of the licensee\n\uf034 the Commission issues it to inactive status at the licensee\u2019s request\n\uf034 it is still renewable but the licensee failed to renew it by the\ndeadline\n\uf034 an individual with a temporary license does not complete the post-\nlicense education requirements and apply for an original\n(permanent) license within the first 6 months of temporary\nlicensure; in this case, the temporary license becomes inactive for\nthe second 6 months of temporary licensure.\nInactive licenses are held at the AREC office until they are activated. To engage\nlegally in real estate activities, the licensee must reactivate his or her license by\nfollowing the procedure outlined in Alabama license law and the AREC rules.\nThe procedure is explained below.\nRecovery Fund\nfee exemption A licensee is not required to pay a Real Estate Recovery Fund fee when his or her\nlicense is issued on inactive status. However, the licensee must pay the fee before\nhe or she can activate the license. If the Commission charged a supplemental\nRecovery Fund fee while the license was in inactive status, the licensee must also\npay that supplemental fee before activating the license.\nReactivation of\nan inactive license Any licensee who wishes to reactivate his or her inactive license must apply to\nthe AREC for an activated license and pay the required fee(s). The fee(s) is\ncharged for each license being changed from inactive to active, but no fee is\ncharged for a license being changed from active to inactive.\nIn addition to applying for reactivation and paying the fee(s), the licensee must\nalso have completed the required 15 hours of continuing education for the current\nlicense period prior to requesting reactivation. The licensee will be required to\ncomplete an additional 15 hours of continuing education to qualify for license\nrenewal for the next license period.\nFor example, let's say that Jim's broker license has been on inactive status for 4\nyears. In April of the fourth year, Jim applies for reactivation. Jim must complete\n15 hours of continuing education for the current 2-year license period that willl\nend in the upcoming August. Then, by August 31 of that same year, Jim will also\nneed to complete an additional 15 hours of continuing education to renew his\nlicense for the next 2-year license period.\nReturn of license If a corporation, partnership, or individually owned company wishes to stop a\nbroker or salesperson from doing business in its name, the entity can notify the\nCommission and the broker or salesperson in writing and return the broker or\nsalesperson's license to the Commission.\nChapter 26: Alabama Licensing Regulation 455",
