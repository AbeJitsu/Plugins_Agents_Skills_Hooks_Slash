<p>Calculating area To find the area of an irregular shape, try dividing it into triangles, rectangles, squares or trapezoids and calculate the areas of those parts; the area of the whole shape is then the sum of the areas of all of its subparts.</p>
<p>Base and height</p>
<p>1. Formulas for area of three- and four-sided shapes use a product of base and height. In the formulas, a represents area, b represents base, h represents height, SF represents square feet.</p>
<p>2. The base of a triangle, square, or rectangle may be any side; a trapezoid has two bases, its two parallel sides.</p>
<p>3. The height of a triangle is the length of a perpendicular line from the base to the triangle's opposite point. Height in a square, rectangle or trapezoid is the length of a line which is perpendicular to the base line(s).</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Real Estate Math 405 Area of a square or rectangle</p>
<p>1. Formula:</p>
<p>area (a) = base (b) x height (h) a = bxh</p>
<p>2. Example:</p>
<p>A square measures 3 feet on each side.</p>
<p>Its area is: 3 x 3 = 9 SF</p>
<p>Area of a triangle</p>
<p>1. Formula:</p>
<p>a = b x h 2</p>
<p>2. Example:</p>
<p>A triangle has a 20' base and a 4' height.</p>
<p>Its area is: a = 20 x 4 2</p>
<h2>= 40 SF</h2>
<p>Area of a trapezoid</p>
<p>1. Formula:</p>
<p>a = a (b1+ b2) 2</p>
<p>2. Example:</p>
<p>A trapezoid's two bases are 10' and 15', and its</p>
<p>height is 7'.</p>
<p>Its area is: a = 7 (10 + 15) 2</p>
<h2>= 87.5 SF</h2>

<p>Listing agreements (Chapter 12) Co-brokerage commission</p>
<p>1. Formulas: sale price x commission rate = total commission</p>
<p>total commission x split rate = co-brokerage commission</p>
<p>2. Example: A house sells for $600,000. The commission is 6%, and</p>
<p>the co-brokerage split is 50-50.</p>
<p>$600,000 x 6% = $36,000 total commission x 50% = $18,000 co-broker's commission</p>
<p>Agent's commission</p>
<p>1. Formula: broker's commission x agent's split rate = agent's</p>
<p>commission</p>
<p>2. Example: Assume an $18,000 broker's commission and a 60% - 40%</p>
<p>agent-broker split rate.</p>
<p>$18,000 x .6 = $10,800 agent's commission ($7,200 to</p>
<p>broker)</p>
<p>Problem 10: A property is co-brokered by listing broker Schroeder and</p>
<p>selling broker Hobson for $425,000. The co-brokerage</p>
<p>split is 50-50. Schroeder's agent, Joachim, is on a 65%</p>
<p>split schedule. Hobson's selling agent, Wallace, splits 50-</p>
<p>50 with her broker. If the total commission rate is 7%,</p>
<p>what are the participants' commissions?</p>
<p>Broker Schroeder: $ Broker Hobson: $ Schroeder's agent, Joachim: $ Hobson's agent, Wallace: $</p>

<p>Brokerage business (Chapter 13) Goodwill calculation</p>
<p>1. Formula: Goodwill = Price - Value of assets</p>
<p>2. Example: A seller wants $1 million for a business. Assets in the</p>
<p>business, including inventory, furniture, equipment,</p>
<p>leasehold improvements, and working capital, have a total</p>
<p>value of $750,000. The goodwill is:</p>
<p>$1,000,000 - 750,000 = $250,000 goodwill</p>
<p>Problem 11: A prospective purchaser complained to a seller that the</p>
<p>selling price had far too much goodwill: $200,000. After</p>
<p>all, the assets only totaled $352,000. What was the price?</p>
<p>Sales contracts (Chapter 14) "Percentage of listing price" calculation</p>
<p>1. Formula: Percentage of listing price = offer divided by listing price</p>
<p>2. Example: A property listed for $400,000 receives an offer for</p>
<p>$360,000. The percentage of listing price is:</p>
<p>$360,000 divided by 400,000 = 90%</p>
<p>Problem 12: A seller receives an offer of $674,000 on a property listed</p>
<p>at $749,000. How much is the offer as a percent of the</p>
<p>listing price?</p>
<p>Earnest money deposit calculation</p>
<p>1. Formula: Deposit = Listing price x required percentage</p>
<p>2. Example: A seller requires a 2% deposit on a property listed for</p>
<p>$320,000. The required deposit is:</p>
<p>$320,000 x 2% = $6,400</p>
<p>Problem 13: A seller requires a 1.5% deposit on all offers. A buyer</p>
<p>wants to offer $312,000 for the property. What must the</p>
<p>deposit be?</p>

<p>Rent escalations</p>
<p>1. Formula: New rent = current rent x (100% + escalation rate)</p>
<p>2. Example: An apartment's rent is scheduled to increase by 6%. If the</p>
<p>current rent is $1800, the new rent is:</p>
<p>$1800 x (100% + 6%) = $1,800 x 106% = $1,908</p>
<p>Problem 14: A tenant's rent is currently $650 per month. This rent is</p>
<p>scheduled to increase 5% per year. What will the tenant's</p>
<p>rent be at the beginning of the third year from now?</p>
<p>FIRPTA withholding</p>
<p>1. Formula: FIRPTA withholding = gross proceeds from sale x 15%</p>
<p>2. Example: Gross proceeds on a FIRPTA-regulated property sale are</p>
<p>$340,000. The required withholding amount is:</p>
<p>$340,000 x 15% = $51,000</p>
<p>Appraisal (Chapter 16) Adjusting comparables</p>
<p>1. Rules: a. NEVER adjust the subject! b. If the comparable is better than the subject, subtract value from the comparable c. If the comparable is worse than the subject, add value to the comparable</p>
<p>2. Examples: a. A comparable has a pool and the subject does not.</p>
<p>The appraiser estimates the value contribution to</p>
<p>be $25,000. Adjust the comparable by entering</p>
<p>-25,000 in the CMA. b. A comparable has 3 bedrooms and the subject as 4. The appraiser estimates the value contribution of a bedroom to be $15,000. Adjust the comparable by entering +15,000 in the CMA.</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Real Estate Math 411</p>
<p>Problem 15: Identify the proper adjustments for the following: (a) The subject has a two-car garage, while the comparable does not. Value of garage is $33,000.</p>
<p>Adjustment:</p>
<p>(b) A comparable has a fireplace, and the subject does not. Value of fireplace is $8,000.</p>
<p>Adjustment:</p>
<p>(c) The subject has 1,500 square feet. The comparable has 1,600 square feet. The value of extra square feet is $200/SF.</p>
<p>Adjustment:</p>
<p>Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)</p>
<p>1. Steps: a. Identify comparable sales</p>
<p>b. Compare comparables to the subject and</p>
<p>make adjustments to comparables. c. Weight values indicated by adjusted comparables for the final value estimate of the subject.</p>
<p>Problem 16: Adjust and weigh comparables to indicate a subject value</p>
<p>a) Using the data and assumptions provided below, complete the worksheet by filling in value adjustments for each blank entry.</p>
<p>b) Total the values of each comparable's adjustments to derive a net value change for the comparable.</p>
<p>c) Reconcile the comparables by weighting their values against each other and estimating a value for the subject.</p>
<p>d) Explain your reasoning.</p>

<p>Discussion of Weighting, Reconciliation and Value Estimate</p>
<p>The completed table indicates four estimated values for the subject, ranging from $880,000 to 1,140,000. For comparable A, the estimator has made three adjustments -- for the number of bedrooms and baths, and for gross living area -- totaling $50,000, or 5.9% of the purchase price. For comparable B, the estimator has deducted values for age, lot, condition, bedrooms, and baths. The total of five adjustments amounts to $70,000, or 7.4% of the sale price. For comparable C, the estimator has adjusted only for the age. The adjustment of $20,000, 2% of sale price, raises the indicated value of the subject to $1,020,000. For comparable D, a deduction has been made for the comparable&rsquo;s superior location. This is offset by additions for the number of bedrooms and gross living area reflecting where the comparable is inferior to the subject. The three adjustments amount to a total of +$50,000, or 4.6% of the sale price.</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Real Estate Math 415</p>
<p>Weighting the indicated values of the comparables, the estimator has developed an indicated value of $1,000,000 for the subject. Underlying this conclusion is the fact that Comparable C is by far the best indicator of value, and therefore receives the heaviest weighting as a value indicator. This property has the fewest adjustments (1) and smallest total adjustment amount (2%). Comparable D might be the second-best indicator, since it has the second-lowest number of adjustments (3), and the net adjustment is also second-best as a percent of the sale price (4.6%). Comparable A might be the third best indicator, since it has the second smallest number of total adjustments (3) but the second highest net adjustment percent (5.9%). Comparable B has the greatest number of adjustments (5) and the highest percent of sale price (7.4%) and is therefore the least reliable indicator.</p>
<p>Income capitalization</p>
<p>Gross rent multiplier (GRM)</p>
<p>1. Formula: gross rent x multiplier = value</p>
<p>2. Example: $2,000 x 135 GRM = $270,000</p>
<p>Gross income multiplier (GIM)</p>
<p>1. Formula: gross annual income x GIM = value</p>
<p>2. Example: $45,000 x 9 GIM = $405,000</p>
<p>Net income capitalization</p>
<p>1. Formula: annual net operating income (NOI) &divide; capitalization rate</p>
<p>= value</p>
<p>2. Example: $50,000 &divide; .10 = $500,000</p>
<p>Problem 17: An apartment building grosses $450,000 annually,</p>
<p>nets 350,000, and has a capitalization rate of 9%.</p>
<p>Prevailing GIMs are 8.</p>
<p>(a) What is the property value using the GIM?</p>
<p>(b) What is the property value using net income capitalization?</p>

<p>Finance (Chapter 17) Interest only loans</p>
<p>1. Formulas: interest payment (I) = principal (P) x interest rate (R)</p>
<p>annual interest payment &divide; 12 = monthly interest payment</p>
<p>monthly interest payment x 12 = annual interest payment</p>
<p>2. Examples: A $300,000 interest-only loan @ 10% has annual</p>
<p>payments of $30,000 and monthly payments of $2,500.</p>
<p>Annual interest = $300,000 x 10% = $30,000</p>
<p>Monthly interest = $30,000 &divide; 12 = $2,500</p>
<p>The loan amount of an interest-only loan that has an annual interest rate of 8% and a monthly interest payment of $700 is $105,000. Annual interest = $700 x 12 = $8,400 Loan amount = $8,400 &divide; .08 = $105,000</p>
<p>Problem 18:</p>
<p>(a) A $250,000 loan carries a 7% rate. What is the monthly interest payment?</p>
<p>(b) A $300,000 loan has monthly payments of $2,000. What is its annual interest rate?</p>
<p>(c) A 12% loan has annual payments of $15,000. What is the loan amount?</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Real Estate Math 417</p>
<p>Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio</p>
<p>1. Formulas: loan amount = market value x LTV</p>
<p>LTV = loan amount &divide; market value</p>
<p>2. Example: A 75% LTV will allow a lender to make a loan of</p>
<p>$375,000 on a $500,000 property.</p>
<p>loan amount = $500,000 x 75% = $375,000</p>
<h2>LTV = $375,000 &divide; $500,000 = 75%</h2>
<p>Problem 19: (a) A lender requires $90,000 down on a $400,000 property. Calculate the lender's required LTV.</p>
<p>(b) A property is valued at $600,000. The lender will allow a maximum LTV of 75%. How much can the buyer borrow on the property?</p>
<p>Income underwriting ratio calculation</p>
<p>1. Formulas: Conventional:</p>
<p>monthly PITI = (25-28%) x monthly gross income</p>
<h2>FHA:</h2>
<p>monthly PITI = 31% x monthly gross income</p>
<p>2. Examples: A borrower has monthly gross income of $2,000.</p>
<p>Conventional lenders are using a ratio of 28%. The</p>
<p>borrower can afford the following monthly PITI</p>
<p>payments:</p>
<p>Conventional:</p>
<p>PITI = 28% x $2,000 = $560</p>
<h2>FHA:</h2>
<p>PITI = 31% x $2,000 = $620</p>

<p>total tax = sum of all taxes by taxing authority</p>
<p>2. Example: The taxable value of a property after exemptions is</p>
<p>400,000 and tax rates are as shown. The property's tax bill</p>
<p>will be:</p>
<p>School tax: $400,000 x 10 mills = $4,000</p>
<p>City tax: $400,000 x 4 mills = 1600</p>

<p>Calculating the proration: 360-day method and 365-day method</p>
<p>1. Calculate the daily proration amount</p>
<p>a. 360-day method: divide the annual amount by 360</p>
<p>or monthly amount by 30</p>
<p>b. 365-day method: divide the annual proration amount by 365, or monthly amount by # days in that month</p>
<p>2. Calculate # of seller&rsquo;s days</p>
<p>a. 360-day method: use 30 days for each month; actual number of seller days within the month, counting (or not counting) the day of closing</p>
<p>b. 365-day method: use actual number of days for each month and partial month</p>
<p>3. Calculate the seller&rsquo;s share Multiply the daily amount times the number of seller&rsquo;s days &ndash; both methods</p>
<p>4. Calculate buyer&rsquo;s share (both methods)</p>
<p>Subtract seller&rsquo;s share (from #3) from total share</p>
<p>426 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama</p>
<p>2. Example: A rental property closes on January 25 and the closing day</p>
<p>is the seller's. The 365-day method will be used for the</p>
<p>prorations. Monthly rent already received by seller is $2,400. Annual real estate taxes to be paid in arrears by buyer are $4,000. Round to the nearest cent.</p>
<p>1. Rent proration: (monthly; 365-day method)</p>
<p>Daily amount: $2,400 monthly rent &divide; 31 days in</p>
<p>January = $77.42</p>
<p># Seller's days: 25</p>
<p>Seller&rsquo;s share: $77.42 x 25 = $1,935.50</p>
<p>Buyer&rsquo;s share: $2,400 &ndash; 1,935.50 = $464.50</p>
<p>Credit buyer and debit seller for buyer's share of $464.50</p>
<p>2. Tax proration: (annual; 365-day method)</p>
<p>Daily amount: $4,000 &divide; 365 = $10.96</p>
<p># Seller's days: 25</p>
<p>Seller&rsquo;s share: $10.96 x 25 = $274</p>
<p>Buyer's share: $4,000 &ndash; 274 = $3,726</p>
<p>Credit buyer and debit seller for seller's share of $274</p>
