Its role is particularly critical in the transfer of real property,\nsince the value of a parcel establishes the general price range for the principal\nparties to negotiate.\nReal estate value in general is the present monetary worth of benefits arising\nfrom the ownership of real estate. The primary benefits that contribute to real\nestate value are:\n\uf034 income\n\uf034 appreciation\n\uf034 use\n\uf034 tax benefits\nOwnership of real estate produces income when there are leases on the land, the\nimprovements, or on air, surface, or subsurface rights. Such income is part of real\nestate value because an investor will pay money to buy the income stream\ngenerated by ownership of the property.\nAppreciation is an increase in the market value of a parcel of land over time,\nusually resulting from a general rise in sale prices of real estate throughout a\nmarket area. Such an increase, whether actual or projected, is another investment\nbenefit that contributes to real estate value.\nThe way a property is used -- whether residential, commercial, agricultural,\nrecreational, etc. -- in large part determines the property's value. Each kind of use\nhas its own benefits.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 223",

    "text": "Depending on current tax law, tax benefits from ownership of a property may\ntake the form of preferred treatment of capital gain, tax losses, depreciation, and\ndeferrals of tax liability. These tax benefits contribute to the income and potential\nsale price of a property.\nFoundations of real\nestate value A number of economic forces interact in the marketplace to contribute to real\nestate value. Among the most recognized of these principles are those listed\nbelow.\nExhibit 16.1 Economic Principles Underlying Real Estate Value\nsupply and demand change\nutility transferability highest and best use\nanticipation substitution conformity\ncontribution progression and regression\nassemblage\nsubdivision\nSupply and demand. The availability of certain properties interacts with the\nstrength of the demand for those properties to establish prices. When demand for\nproperties exceeds supply, a condition of scarcity exists, and real estate values\nrise. When supply exceeds demand, a condition of surplus exists, and real estate\nvalues decline. When supply and demand are generally equivalent, the market is\nconsidered to be in balance, and real estate values stabilize.\nUtility. The fact that a property has a use in a certain marketplace contributes to\nthe demand for it. Use is not the same as function. For instance, a swampy area\nmay have an ecological function as a wetland, but it may have no economic utility\nif it cannot be put to some use that people in the marketplace are willing to pay\nfor.\nTransferability. How readily or easily title or rights to real estate can be\ntransferred affects the property's value. Property that is encumbered has a value\nimpairment since buyers do not want unmarketable title. Similarly, property that\ncannot be transferred due to disputes among owners may cause the value to\ndecline, because the investment is wholly illiquid until the disputes are resolved.\nAnticipation. The benefits a buyer expects to derive from a property over a\nholding period influence what the buyer is willing to pay for it. For example, if\nan investor anticipates an annual rental income from a leased property to be one\nmillion dollars, this expected sum has a direct bearing on what the investor will\npay for the property.\nSubstitution. According to the principle of substitution, a buyer will pay no more\nfor a property than the buyer would have to pay for an equally desirable and\navailable substitute property. For example, if three houses for sale are essentially\nsimilar in size, quality and location, a potential buyer is unlikely to choose the\none that is priced significantly higher than the other two.\nContribution. The principal of contribution focuses on the degree to which a\nparticular improvement affects market value of the overall property. In essence,\nthe contribution of the improvement is equal to the change in market value that\nthe addition of the improvement causes. For example, adding a bathroom to a\nhouse may contribute an additional $15,000 to the appraised value. Thus the\ncontribution of the bathroom is $15,000. Note that an improvement's contribution\n224 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "to value has little to do with the improvement's cost. The foregoing bathroom\nmay have cost $5,000 or $20,000. Contribution is what the market recognizes as\nthe change in value, not what an item cost. If continuous improvements are added\nto a property, it is possible that, at some point, the cost of adding improvements\nto a property no longer contributes a corresponding increase in the value of the\nproperty. When this occurs, the property suffers from diminishing marginal\nreturn, where the costs to improve exceed contribution.\nChange. Market conditions are in a state of flux over time, just as the condition\nof a property itself changes. These fluctuations and changes will affect the\nbenefits that can arise from the property, and should be reflected in an estimate of\nthe property's value. For example, the construction of a neighborhood shopping\ncenter in the vicinity of a certain house may increase the desirability of the\nhouse's location, and hence, its value.\nHighest and best use. This principle holds that there is, theoretically, a single\nuse for a property that produces the greatest income and return. A property\nachieves its maximum value when it is put to this use. If the actual use is not the\nhighest and best use, the value of the property is correspondingly less than\noptimal. Technically, highest and best use must be legally permissible, physically\npossible, financially feasible, and maximally productive.\nFor example, a property with an old house on it may not be in its highest and best\nuse if it is surrounded by retail properties. If zoning permits the property to be\nconverted to a retail use, its highest and best use may well be retail rather than\nresidential.\nConformity. This principle holds that a property's maximal value is attained\nwhen its form and use are in tune with surrounding properties and uses. For\nexample, a two-bedroom, one-bathroom house surrounded by four-bedroom,\nthree-bathroom homes may derive maximal value from a room addition.\nProgression and regression. The value of a property influences, and is\ninfluenced by, the values of neighboring properties. If a property is surrounded\nby properties with higher values, its value will tend to rise (progression); if it is\nsurrounded by properties with lower values, its value will tend to fall\n(regression).\nAssemblage. Assemblage, or the conjoining of adjacent properties, sometimes\ncreates a combined value that is greater than the values of the unassembled\nproperties. The excess value created by assemblage is called plottage value.\nSubdivision. The division of a single property into smaller properties can also\nresult in a higher total value. For instance, a one-acre suburban site appraised at\n$50,000 may be subdivided into four quarter-acre lots worth $30,000 each. This\nprinciple contributes significantly to the financial feasibility of subdivision\ndevelopment.\nTypes of value The purpose of an appraisal influences an estimate of the value of a parcel of real\nestate. This is because there are different types of value related to different\nappraisal purposes. Some of the possibilities are listed below.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 225",

Market value is an estimate of the price at which a property will\nsell at a particular time. This type of value is the one generally sought in\nappraisals and used in brokers' estimates of value.\nReproduction value. Reproduction value is the value based on the cost of\nconstructing a precise duplicate of the subject property's improvements, assuming\ncurrent construction costs.\nReplacement value. Replacement value is the value based on the cost of\nconstructing a functional equivalent of the subject property's improvements,\nassuming current construction costs.\nSalvage value. Salvage value refers to the nominal value of a property that has\nreached the end of its economic life. Salvage value is also an estimate of the price\nat which a structure will sell if it is dismantled and moved.\nPlottage value. Plottage value is an estimate of the value that the process of\nassemblage adds to the combined values of the assembled properties.\nAssessed value. Assessed value is the value of a property as estimated by a\ntaxing authority as the basis for ad valorem taxation.\nCondemned value. Condemned value is the value set by a county or municipal\nauthority for a property which may be taken by eminent domain.\nDepreciated value. Depreciated value is a value established by subtracting\naccumulated depreciation from the purchase price of a property.\nReversionary value. Reversionary value is the estimated selling price of a\nproperty at some time in the future. This value is used most commonly in a\nproforma investment analysis where, at the end of a holding period, the property\nis sold and the investor's capital reverts to the investor.\nAppraised value. Appraised value is an appraiser's opinion of a property's value.\nRental value. Rental value is an estimate of the rental rate a property can\ncommand for a specific period of time.\nLeasehold value. Leasehold value is an estimate of the market value of a lessee's\ninterest in a property.\nInsured value. Insured value is the face amount a casualty or hazard insurance\npolicy will pay in case a property is rendered unusable.\n226 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Market price should theoretically be the same as market value if all the\nconditions essential for market value were present. Market price, however, may\nnot reflect the analysis of comparables and of investment value that an estimate\nof market value includes.\nThe appraisal\nand its uses While most appraisals seek to estimate market value, any of the types of value\ndescribed earlier may be the objective of an appraisal. An appraisal is\ndistinguished from other estimates of value in that it is an opinion of value\nsupported by data and performed by a professional, disinterested third party.\nAppraisers acting in a professional capacity are also regulated by state laws and\nbound to standards set by the appraisal industry.\nBroker's opinion of value. A broker's opinion of value may resemble an\nappraisal, but it differs from an appraisal in that it is not necessarily performed by\na disinterested third party or licensed professional and it generally uses only a\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 227",

The appraisal itself is used in real estate decision-making to estimate one or\nmore types of value, depending on the kind of decision to be made. Appraisals\nmay be ordered and used by mortgage lenders, government agencies, investors,\nutilities companies, and real estate buyers and sellers.\nAn appraisal helps in setting selling prices and rental rates, determining the level\nof insurance coverage, establishing investment values, and establishing the value\nof the real estate as collateral for a loan.\nAppraisals may be developed and reported in a narrative format or on a\nprescribed form with attachments. The most commonly used form for residential\nappraisals is the \"Uniform Residential Appraisal Report\" (URAR) promoted by\nthe Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan\nMortgage Corporation (FHLMC) (known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\nrespectively).\nMeasuring living\narea The concept of living area is fundamental to estimating residential property\nvalue, since a subject's living area is a major component of its desirability and\nmarket value. But what is living area, and how is it measured? Standards differ\nfrom state to state.\nANSI and Fannie Mae standards. ANSI (American National Standards\nInstitute) and Fannie Mae are the two most prominent organizations which\noriginate and propound modern measuring standards in national real estate\npractice. Current living area measurement standards can be found in ANSI and\nFannie Mae literature. The following guidelines are general and not intended to\nbe rigid or comprehensive. Practitioners must always be aware of and follow\nlocal measurement standards..\nThe principal ANSI and Fannie Mae standards for measuring gross living area\n(GLA) include the following. These standards mainly apply to single-family\nresidential properties.\n1. Gross living area is based on the dimensions of all rooms \"above grade\" as\nmeasured from the exterior walls of the premises, including stairwells but\nexcluding \"open areas.\" Space should be measured to the inch or to 1/10th of\na foot and living areas calculated and totaled.\n2. Above grade is defined as above the surface of the ground. Living area\nbelow-grade (one foot or more) must be counted as basement area \u2013 thus not\nas 100% living area.\n3. Minimum ceiling height for living area is 7 feet. In two-story properties (or\nmore) with sloped ceilings, at least 50% of the ceiling area must have a\nheight of 7 feet or more.\n4. Finished space: To be counted in GLA footage, a space must be finished,\ni.e., have a floor covering and a ceiling. Entry areas may be counted, but\nseasonal porches are excluded.\n228 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

For example, an\nunattached outbuilding cannot be counted in the total.\n6. Attics and basements: Partially finished or only partially heated areas may\nnot be counted as 100% GLA footage. Since these standards can vary widely\nfrom state to state, practitioners should ascertain the local standards that\napply.\n7. Garage areas are not fully countable if they are unattached, or attached but\nnot heated. However, they may meet a local standard if fully heated, finished\nand improved for other household uses.\n8. Stairs and closets: Both these improvement areas are generally fully\ncountable in GLA.\nUltimately, the most accurate measurement of living areas relies heavily on\nadherence to local standards and practices, and to practices dictated by mortgage\nunderwriters.\nSteps in the\nappraisal process A systematic procedure enables an appraiser to collect, organize and analyze the\nnecessary data to produce an appraisal report.\nExhibit 16.3 Steps in the Appraisal Process\n1. Identify the purpose\n2. Assimilate relevant data\n3. Assess the highest and best use\n4. Estimate the value of the land\n5. Apply the three approaches to\nestimating value\n6. Reconcile the values from the\napproaches\n7. Compile the report\nPurpose. The first step in the process is to define the appraisal problem and the\npurpose of the appraisal. This involves\n\uf034 identifying the subject property by legal description\n\uf034 specifying the interest to be appraised\n\uf034 specifying the purpose of the appraisal, for example, to identify\nmarket value for a purchase, identify rental levels, or establish a\nvalue as collateral for a loan\n\uf034 specifying the date for which the appraisal is valid\n\uf034 identifying the type of value to be estimated\nData. The second step is to collect, organize and analyze relevant data about the\nsubject property. Information relevant to the property includes notes and drawings\nfrom physical inspection of the subject, public tax and title records, and\nreproduction costs. Relevant information about the market includes\nenvironmental, demographic, and economic reports concerning the neighborhood,\ncommunity, and region.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 229",

It also serves as the basis for a broker's opinion of value.\nIt is based on the principle of substitution-- that a buyer will pay no more for the\nsubject property than would be sufficient to purchase a comparable property--\nand contribution-- that specific characteristics add value to a property.\nThe sales comparison approach is widely used because it takes into account the\nsubject property's specific amenities in relation to competing properties. In\naddition, because of the currency of its data, the approach incorporates present\nmarket realities.\nThe sales comparison approach is limited in that every property is unique. As a\nresult, it is difficult to find good comparables, especially for special-purpose\nproperties. In addition, the market must be active; otherwise, sale prices lack\ncurrency and reliability.\n230 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Steps in\nthe approach The sales comparison approach consists of comparing sale prices of recently sold\nproperties that are comparable with the subject and making dollar adjustments to\nthe price of each comparable to account for competitive differences with the\nsubject. After identifying the adjusted value of each comparable, the appraiser\nweights the reliability of each comparable and the factors underlying how the\nadjustments were made. The weighting yields a final value range based on the\nmost reliable factors in the analysis.\nExhibit 16.4 Steps in the Sales Comparison Approach\n1. Identify comparable sales.\n2.

For example, to qualify as a comparable for a mortgage loan appraisal, a\nproperty might have to be located within one mile of the subject. Or perhaps the\nsize of the comparable must be within a certain percentage of improved area in\nrelation to the subject.\nThe time-of-sale criterion is important because transactions that occurred too far\nin the past will not reflect appreciation or recent changes in market conditions.\nAn arm's length sale involves objective, disinterested parties who are presumed to\nhave negotiated a market price for the property. If the sale of a house occurred\nbetween a father and a daughter, for example, one might assume that the\ntransaction did not reflect market value.\nPrincipal sources of data for generating the sales comparison are tax records, title\nrecords, and the local multiple listing service.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 231",

    "text": "Adjusting\ncomparables The appraiser adjusts the sale prices of the comparables to account for\ncompetitive differences with the subject property. Note that the sale prices of the\ncomparables are known, while the value and price of the subject are not.\nTherefore, adjustments can be made only to the comparables' prices, not to the\nsubject's. Adjustments are made to the comparables in the form of a value\ndeduction or a value addition.\nAdding or deducting value. If the comparable is better than the subject in some\ncharacteristic, an amount is deducted from the sale price of the comparable. This\nneutralizes the comparable's competitive advantage in an adjustment category.\nFor example, a comparable has a swimming pool and the subject does not. To\nequalize the difference, the appraiser deducts an amount, say $6,000, from the\nsale price of the comparable. Note that the adjustment reflects the contribution of\nthe swimming pool to market value. The adjustment amount is not the cost of the\npool or its depreciated value.\nIf the comparable is inferior to the subject in some characteristic, an amount is\nadded to the price of the comparable. This adjustment equalizes the subject's\ncompetitive advantage in this area.\nAdjustment criteria. The principal factors for comparison and adjustment are\ntime of sale, location, physical characteristics, and transaction characteristics.\n\uf034 time of sale\nAn adjustment may be made if market conditions, market prices,\nor financing availability have changed significantly since the date\nof the comparable's sale.

    "text": "Weighting\ncomparables Adding and subtracting the appropriate adjustments to the sale price of each\ncomparable results in an adjusted price for the comparables that indicates the\nvalue of the subject. The last step in the approach is to perform a weighted\nanalysis of the indicated values of each comparable. The appraiser, in other\nwords, must identify which comparable values are more indicative of the subject\nand which are less indicative.\nAn appraiser primarily relies on experience and judgment to weight comparables.\nThere is no formula for selecting a value from within the range of all\ncomparables analyzed. However, there are three quantitative guidelines: the total\nnumber of adjustments; the amount of a single adjustment; and the net value\nchange of all adjustments.\nAs a rule, the fewer the total number of adjustments, the smaller the adjustment\namounts, and the less the total adjustment amount, the more reliable the\ncomparable.\nNumber of adjustments. In terms of total adjustments, the comparable with the\nfewest adjustments tends to be most similar to the subject, hence the best\nindicator of value. If a comparable requires excessive adjustments, it is\nincreasingly less reliable as an indicator of value. The underlying rationale is that\nthere is a margin of error involved in making any adjustment. Whenever a\nnumber of adjustments must be made, the margin of error compounds. By the\ntime six or seven adjustments are made, the margin becomes significant, and the\nreliability of the final value estimate is greatly reduced.\nSingle adjustment amounts. The dollar amount of an adjustment represents the\nvariance between the subject and the comparable for a given item. If a large\nadjustment is called for, the comparable becomes less of an indicator of value.\nThe smaller the adjustment, the better the comparable is as an indicator of value.\nIf an appraisal is performed for mortgage qualification, the appraiser may be\nrestricted from making adjustments in excess of a certain amount, for example,\nanything in excess of 10-15% of the sale price of the comparable. If such an\nadjustment would be necessary, the property is no longer considered comparable.\nTotal net adjustment amount. The third reliability factor in weighting\ncomparables is the total net value change of all adjustments added together. If a\ncomparable's total adjustments alter the indicated value only slightly, the\ncomparable is a good indicator of value. If total adjustments create a large dollar\namount between the sale price and the adjusted value, the comparable is a poorer\nindicator of value. Fannie Mae, for instance, will not accept the use of a\ncomparable where total net adjustments are in excess of 15% of the sale price.\nFor example, an appraiser is considering a property that sold for $500,000 as a\ncomparable. After all adjustments are made, the indicated value of the\ncomparable is $605,000, a 21% difference in the comparable's sale price. This\nproperty, if allowed at all, would be a weak indicator of value.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 233",

While the CMA serves a useful purpose in\nsetting general price ranges, brokers and agents need to exercise caution in\npresenting a CMA as an appraisal, which it is not. Two important distinctions\nbetween the two are objectivity and comprehensiveness.\nFirst, the broker is not unbiased: he or she is motivated by the desire to obtain a\nlisting, which can lead one to distort the estimated price. Secondly, the broker's\nCMA is not comprehensive: the broker does not usually consider the full range\nof data about market conditions and comparable sales that the appraiser must\nconsider and document. Therefore, the broker's opinion will be less reliable than\nthe appraiser's.\nThe following exhibit illustrates the sales comparison approach. An appraiser is\nestimating market value for a certain house. Four comparables are adjusted to\nfind an indicated value for the subject.

It is also used for\nspecial-purpose buildings which cannot be valued by the other methods because\nof lack of comparable sales or income data.\nThe strengths of the cost approach are that it:\n\uf034 provides an upper limit for the subject's value based on the\nundepreciated cost of reproducing the improvements\n\uf034 is very accurate for a property with new improvements which are\nthe highest and best use of the property.\nThe limitations of the cost approach are that:\n\uf034 the cost to create improvements is not necessarily the same as\nmarket value\n\uf034 depreciation is difficult to measure, especially for older buildings\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 237",

    "text": "Types of cost\nappraised The cost approach generally aims to estimate either the reproduction cost or the\nreplacement cost of the subject property.\nReproduction cost is the cost of constructing, at current prices, a precise\nduplicate of the subject improvements. Replacement cost is the cost of\nconstructing, at current prices and using current materials and methods, a\nfunctional equivalent of the subject improvements.\nReplacement cost is used primarily for appraising older structures, since it is\nimpractical to consider reproducing outmoded features and materials. However,\nreproduction cost is preferable whenever possible because it facilitates the\ncalculation of depreciation on a structure.\nDepreciation A cornerstone of the cost approach is the concept of depreciation. Depreciation is\nthe loss of value in an improvement over time. Since land is assumed to retain its\nvalue indefinitely, depreciation only applies to the improved portion of real\nproperty. The loss of an improvement's value can come from any cause, such as\ndeterioration, obsolescence, or changes in the neighborhood. The sum of\ndepreciation from all causes is accrued depreciation.\nAn appraiser considers depreciation as having three causes: physical\ndeterioration, functional obsolescence, and economic obsolescence.\nPhysical deterioration. Physical deterioration is wear and tear from use, decay,\nand structural deterioration. Such deterioration may be either curable or\nincurable.\nCurable deterioration occurs when the costs of repair of the item are less than or\nequal to the resulting increase in the property's value. For example, if a paint job\ncosts $6,000, and the resulting value increase is $8,000, the deterioration is\nconsidered curable. Incurable deterioration is the opposite: the repair will cost\nmore than can be recovered by its contribution to the value of the building. For\nexample, if the foregoing paint job cost $10,000, the deterioration would be\nconsidered incurable.\nFunctional obsolescence. Functional obsolescence occurs when a property has\noutmoded physical or design features which are no longer desirable to current\nusers. If the obsolescence is curable, the cost of replacing or redesigning the\noutmoded feature would be offset by the contribution to overall value, for\nexample, a lack of central air conditioning. If the functional obsolescence is\nincurable, the cost of the cure would exceed the contribution to overall value, for\nexample, a floor layout with a bad traffic pattern that would cost three times as\nmuch as the ending contribution to value.\nEconomic obsolescence. Economic (or external) obsolescence is the loss of\nvalue due to adverse changes in the surroundings of the subject property that\nmake the subject less desirable. Since such changes are usually beyond the\ncontrol of the property owner, economic obsolescence is considered an incurable\nvalue loss. Examples of economic obsolescence include a deteriorating\nneighborhood, a rezoning of adjacent properties, or the bankruptcy of a large\nemployer.\n238 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Steps in the approach The cost approach consists of estimating the value of the land \"as if vacant;\"\nestimating the cost of improvements; estimating and deducting accrued\ndepreciation; and adding the estimated land value to the estimated depreciated\ncost of the improvements.\nExhibit 16.6 Steps in the Cost Approach\n1. Estimate land value.\n2. Estimate reproduction or replacement cost of\nimprovements.\n3. Estimate accrued depreciation.\n4. Subtract accrued depreciation from\nreproduction or replacement cost.\n5. Add land value to depreciated reproduction or\nreplacement cost.\nEstimate land value. To estimate land value, the appraiser uses the sales\ncomparison method: find properties which are comparable to the subject property\nin terms of land and adjust the sale prices of the comparables to account for\ncompetitive differences with the subject property. Common adjustments concern\nlocation, physical characteristics, and time of sale. The indicated values of the\ncomparable properties are used to estimate the land value of the subject. The\nimplicit assumption is that the subject land is vacant (unimproved) and available\nfor the highest and best use.\nEstimate reproduction or replacement cost of improvements. There are\nseveral methods for estimating the reproduction or replacement cost of\nimprovements. These are as follows.\n\uf034 unit comparison method (square-foot method)\nThe appraiser examines one or more new structures that are similar\nto the subject's improvements, determines a cost per unit for the\nbenchmark structures, and multiplies this cost per unit times the\nnumber of units in the subject. The unit of measurement is most\ncommonly denominated in square feet.\n\uf034 unit-in-place method\nThe appraiser uses materials cost manuals and estimates of labor\ncosts, overhead, and builder's profit to estimate the cost of\nconstructing separate components of the subject. The overall cost\nestimate is the sum of the estimated costs of individual\ncomponents.\n\uf034 quantity survey method\nThe appraiser considers in detail all materials, labor, supplies,\noverhead and profit to get an accurate estimate of the actual cost\nto build the improvement. More thorough than the unit-in-place\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 239",

    "text": "method, this method is used less by appraisers than it is by engineers\nand architects.\n\uf034 cost indexing method\nThe original cost of constructing the improvement is updated by\napplying a percentage increase factor to account for increases in\nnominal costs over time.\nEstimate accrued depreciation. Accrued depreciation is often estimated by the\nstraight-line method, also called the economic age-life method. This method\nassumes that depreciation occurs at a steady rate over the economic life of the\nstructure. Therefore, a property suffers the same incremental loss of value each\nyear.\nThe economic life is the period during which the structure is expected to remain\nuseful in its original use. The cost of the structure is divided by the number of\nyears of economic life to determine an annual amount for depreciation. The\nstraight-line method is primarily relevant to depreciation from physical\ndeterioration.\nSubtract accrued depreciation from reproduction or replacement cost. The\nsum of accrued depreciation from all sources is subtracted from the estimated\ncost of reproducing or replacing the structure. This produces an estimate of the\ncurrent value of the improvements.\nAdd land value to depreciated reproduction or replacement cost. To\ncomplete the cost approach, the estimated value of the land \"as if vacant\" is\nadded to the estimated value of the depreciated reproduction or replacement cost\nof the improvements. This yields the final value estimate for the property by the\ncost approach.\n240 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The approach is based on the principle of\nanticipation: the expected future income stream of a property underlies what an\ninvestor will pay for the property. It is also based on the principle of substitution:\nthat an investor will pay no more for a subject property with a certain income\nstream than the investor would have to pay for another property with a similar\nincome stream.\nChapter 16: Appraising and Estimating Market Value 241",

    "text": "The strength of the income approach is that it is used by investors themselves to\ndetermine how much they should pay for a property. Thus, in the right\ncircumstances, it provides a good basis for estimating market value.\nThe income capitalization approach is limited in two ways. First, it is difficult to\ndetermine an appropriate capitalization rate. This is often a matter of judgment\nand experience on the part of the appraiser. Secondly, the income approach relies\non market information about income and expenses, and it can be difficult to find\nsuch information.\nSteps in the approach The income capitalization method consists of estimating annual net operating\nincome from the subject property, then applying a capitalization rate to the\nincome. This produces a principal amount that the investor would pay for the\nproperty.\nExhibit 16.8 Steps in the Income Capitalization Approach\n1. Estimate potential gross income.\n2.

Scheduled rent is the total rent a property will produce if fully\nleased at the established rental rates.\nScheduled rent\n+ Other income\nPotential gross income\nAn appraiser may estimate potential gross rental income using current market\nrental rates (market rent), the rent specified by leases in effect on the property\n(contract rent), or a combination of both. Market rent is determined by market\nstudies in a process similar to the sales comparison method. Contract rent is used\nprimarily if the existing leases are not due to expire in the short term and the\ntenants are unlikely to fail or leave the lease.\nEstimate effective gross income. Effective gross income is potential gross\nincome minus an allowance for vacancy and credit losses.\nPotential gross income\n- Vacancy & credit losses\nEffective gross income\n242 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Vacancy loss refers to an amount of potential income lost because of unrented\nspace. Credit loss refers to an amount lost because of tenants' failure to pay rent\nfor any reason. Both are estimated on the basis of the subject property's history,\ncomparable properties in the market, and assuming typical management quality.\nThe allowance for vacancy and credit loss is usually estimated as a percentage of\npotential gross income.\nEstimate net operating income. Net operating income is effective gross income\nminus total operating expenses.\nEffective gross income\n- Total operating expenses\nNet operating income\nOperating expenses include fixed expenses and variable expenses. Fixed\nexpenses are those that are incurred whether the property is occupied or vacant,\nfor example, real estate taxes and hazard insurance. Variable expenses are those\nthat relate to actual operation of the building, for example, utilities, janitorial\nservice, management, and repairs.\nOperating expenses typically include an annual reserve fund for replacement of\nequipment and other items that wear out periodically, such as carpets and heating\nsystems. Operating expenses do not include debt service, expenditures for capital\nimprovements, or expenses not related to operation of the property.\nSelect a capitalization rate. The capitalization rate is an estimate of the rate of\nreturn an investor will demand on the investment of capital in a property such as\nthe subject. The judgment and market knowledge of the appraiser play an\nessential role in the selection of an appropriate rate for the subject property. In\nmost cases, the appraiser will research capitalization rates used on similar\nproperties in the market.\nApply the capitalization rate.
