The Commission's role is to serve and protect the\npublic through the licensing and regulating of real estate professionals. The\nAREC enforces Alabama license laws which were created to regulate real estate\nprofessionals and the practice of real estate business. The AREC also creates and\nenforces its own rules to further regulate the practice of real estate business in\nAlabama.\nThe 1927 Act was expanded by the Real Estate License Law of 1951 and then\namended in 1953, 1963, and 1982 to further regulate real estate licensing.\nCommission key\ncharacteristics The Commission is made up of nine commissioners who are appointed by the\nGovernor with the advice and consent of the State Senate. The appointments are\nmade from a list of three persons nominated by the Alabama Professional Real\nEstate Society or trade association. The appointment is to be made within 30 days\nof receiving the list, or the Society will provide a second list of three persons,\ngiving the Governor six names from which to appoint one commissioner. At least\none of the names submitted must not be a member of the Society or trade\nassociation.\nThe nine members of the Commission consist of seven members who must have\nbeen residents and citizens of Alabama for at least 10 years and must also have\nbeen real estate brokers or salespersons for at least 10 years. Commissioners may\nnot have been convicted of federal or state license law violations. Each member\nmust also be from different U.S. Congressional Districts.

The Commission may choose to suspend\nthe revocation or suspension while the licensee is completing the educational\ncourse or making restitution.\nIf a licensee, firm, corporation, or other business entity has violated any Alabama\nlicense law, rule, or regulation, the Commission may take legal action through\nthe Attorney General to stop the violation and to enforce the law or rule. The\nlegal action can be taken even if an adequate legal remedy does not exist or there\nis no proof that irreparable damage would result from the continued violation.\nIf the accused party or entity is unlicensed and engaging in activities which\nrequire licensure, the Commission may issue an order to cease and desist the\nactivities. The executive director will issue the order after the Commission staff\nfinds probable cause. The order will become final 15 days after service unless the\naccused requests a hearing before the AREC. If the hearing results in the finding\nof a violation, the cease and desist order may become final and the Commission\nmay impose an appropriate fine for each violation. The Commission may also\nimpose a fine in the amount of any gain or economic benefit that resulted from\nthe violation, as well as a fine in the amount of the costs incurred by the\nCommission.

However, sometimes the licensee does not pay any or all of the\ndamages, so the complainant may not be fully compensated for the damages. To\naddress this situation, Alabama law requires the AREC to establish and maintain\na Recovery Fund.\nPurpose of the\nfund The Recovery Fund was established to assist an aggrieved party in recovering\nactual or compensatory damages not paid by the licensee in cases where the\nlicensee has been ordered to pay such damages. The damages must have been\nsustained within Alabama and must have been the result of conduct of a broker or\nsalesperson that is in violation of Article 1 or 2 of the Alabama License Law or\nof AREC rules. The Recovery Fund is not used to pay interest or court costs.\nPayment into the\nfund The Recovery Fund is funded by a fee of $30 paid by each applicant for an\noriginal broker or salesperson license. This fee is in addition to any other fee paid\nby the applicant. The $30 is deposited into the Recovery Fund. If the\nCommission does not issue the applicant's license, the fee is refunded to the\napplicant.\nIf a salesperson pays the Recovery Fund fee at the time he or she applies for the\nsalesperson license, he or she is not obligated to pay the fee again if/when\napplying for a broker license. If the salesperson does pay the fee a second time,\nhe or she can request a refund of the extra Recovery Fund fee paid.\nThe Recovery Fund fee is only paid once at the time of application for an original\nbroker or salesperson license, unless the Fund's balance drops below the\nminimum required.\nMonies received for the Recovery Fund are to be deposited into the State\nTreasury and held in the Recovery Fund in trust by the AREC.
