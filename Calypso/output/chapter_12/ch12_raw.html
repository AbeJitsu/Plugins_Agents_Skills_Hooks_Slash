<p>Review of Legal Foundations Types of Listing Agreement Fulfillment and Termination Agreement Clauses</p>
<h2>REVIEW OF LEGAL FOUNDATIONS</h2>
<p>Agency law Contract law A listing agreement, the document that puts an agent or broker in business, is a legally enforceable real estate agency agreement between a real estate broker and a client, authorizing the broker to perform a stated service for compensation. The unique characteristic of a listing agreement is that it is governed both by agency law and by contract law. Agency law The cornerstones of agency law in the context of a listing agreement are:  definition of the roles of parties involved  fiduciary duties of the agent  agent's scope of authority Parties. The principal parties to the contract are the listing broker and the client. The client may be buyer, seller, landlord or tenant in the proposed transaction. Legally, the broker is the client's agent. The principal party on the other side of the transaction is a customer or a potential customer, called a prospect. A broker or salesperson who assists the listing broker in finding a customer is an agent of the listing broker and a subagent of the client. A broker who represents the party on the other side of the transaction is an agent of that party, and not an agent of the listing broker, unless a dual agency arrangement is specifically allowed. Fiduciary duties. A listing agreement establishes an agency relationship between agent and client that commits the agent to the full complement of fiduciary duties to the client in fulfilling the agreement. Scope of authority. Customarily, a listing is a special agency, or limited agency, agreement. Special agency limits the scope of the broker's authority to specific activities, generally those which generate customers and catalyze the transaction. A special agency agreement usually does not authorize a broker to obligate the client to a contract as a principal party, unless the agreement expressly grants such authorization or the client has granted power of attorney to the broker. For example, a listing broker may not tell a buyer that the seller will accept an offer 12</p>
<p>158 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama regardless of its terms. Telling the offeror that the offer is accepted would be an even more serious breach of the agreement. Under agency law, a client is liable for actions the broker performs that are within the scope of authority granted by the listing agreement. A client is not liable for acts of the broker which go beyond the stated or implied scope of authority. Thus, in the previous example, the seller would not be liable for the broker's statements that the offer would be accepted or was accepted, since the broker did not have the authority to make such statements. A broker who exceeds the scope of authority in the listing agreement risks forfeiting compensation and perhaps even greater liabilities. Contract law Bilateral or unilateral agreement. Listings may be bilateral or unilateral, depending on the type of listing and the wording of the agreement. An open listing is a unilateral agreement in that the seller promises to pay a commission to any agent who produces a buyer but no agent promises or is obligated to take any action. On the other hand, most exclusive listings are bilateral agreements because of wording that promises the due diligence of the agent to procure a buyer in return for the seller&rsquo;s promise to pay a commission if a buyer is produced. Validity. A listing agreement must meet the requirements for a valid contract to be enforceable. Termination. A listing, like any contract, may terminate for any of the following causes: performance, infeasibility, mutual agreement, rescission, revocation, abandonment, lapse of time, invalidity, and breach. Legal form. A valid listing may be oral or written. However, many states consider only a written listing to be enforceable, particularly an exclusive right- to-sell listing. In practice, a broker should get every listing in writing and make sure it clearly states what the broker is authorized to do and how the broker will be paid. An oral listing, even if enforceable, limits a broker's ability to remedy problems:</p>
<p> a contested oral listing must be supported by considerable evidence to be enforced  a broker may not be able to sue a principal for damages incurred under an oral lease  if the client dies, the broker may not be able to obtain compensation for a successfully performed oral listing</p>
<p>An express listing, verbal or written, manifestly authorizes the broker to pursue certain actions for the client. Clients and agents may also create an implied agency listing based on substantive actions rather than on an express agreement. For example, if a seller allows a broker to undertake certain activities toward effecting a transaction without a specific authorization, but with full knowledge and consent, an implied agency may have been created. Consequently, if the principal proceeds with a customer procured in this manner, he or she may be</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 159 liable to the broker for compensation. Conversely, the agent may be held responsible for fulfilling fiduciary duties imposed by the implied agency. Assignment. Since a listing agreement is a personal service contract, it is not assignable. In particular, a broker cannot assign a listing to another broker.</p>
<h2>TYPES OF LISTING AGREEMENT</h2>
<p>Exclusive right-to-sell (or lease) Exclusive agency Open listing Net listing Buyer and tenant agency agreement Transaction broker agreement Multiple listing Limited services agreement A broker may represent any principal party of a transaction: seller, landlord, buyer, tenant. An owner listing authorizes a broker to represent an owner or landlord. There are three main types of owner listing agreement: exclusive right- to-sell (or lease); exclusive agency; and open listing. Another type of listing, rarely used today and illegal in many states, is a net listing. The first three forms differ in their statement of conditions under which the broker will be paid. The net listing is a variation on how much the broker will be paid. A buyer agency or tenant representation agreement authorizes a broker to represent a buyer or tenant. The most commonly used form is an exclusive right- to-represent agreement, the equivalent of an exclusive right-to-sell. However, exclusive agency and open types of agreement may be also used to secure a relationship on this side of a transaction. Though not a distinct type of listing agreement, multiple listing is a significant feature of brokerage practice. Multiple listing is an authorization to enter a listing in a multiple listing service. Exclusive right- to-sell (or lease) The exclusive right-to-sell, also called exclusive authorization-to-sell and, simply, the exclusive, is the most widely used owner agreement. Under the terms of this listing, a seller contracts exclusively with a single broker to procure a buyer or effect a sale transaction. If a buyer is procured during the listing period, the broker is entitled to a commission, regardless of who is procuring cause. Thus, if anyone-the owner, another broker-- sells the property, the owner must pay the listing broker the contracted commission. The exclusive right-to-lease is a similar contract for a leasing transaction. Under the terms of this listing, the owner or landlord must pay the listing broker a commission if anyone procures a tenant for the named premises. The exclusive listing gives the listing broker the greatest assurance of receiving compensation for marketing efforts.</p>
<p>160 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama In some states, an exclusive right-to-sell listing is enforceable only if it is in writing and has an expiration date. Some states do not require the agreement to be in writing, but if it is in writing, it must have an expiration date. Exclusive agency An exclusive agency listing authorizes a single broker to sell the property and earn a commission, but leaves the owner the right to sell the property without the broker's assistance, in which case no commission is owed. Thus, if any party other than the owner is procuring cause in a completed sale of the property, including another broker, the contracted broker has earned the commission. This arrangement may also be used in a leasing transaction: if any party other than the owner procures the tenant, the owner must compensate the listing broker. An exclusive agency listing generally must have an expiration date. Most states allow either an oral or written agreement. Open listing An open listing, or, simply, open, is a non-exclusive authorization to sell or lease a property. The owner may offer such agreements to any number of brokers in the marketplace. With an open listing, the broker who is the first to perform under the terms of the listing is the sole party entitled to a commission. Performance usually consists of being the procuring cause in the finding of a ready, willing, and able customer. If the transaction occurs without a procuring broker, no commissions are payable. Open listings are rare in residential brokerage. Brokers generally shy away from them because they offer no assurance of compensation for marketing efforts. In addition, open listings cause commission disputes. To avoid such disputes, a broker has to register prospects with the owner to provide evidence of procuring cause in case a transaction results. An open listing may be oral or written. Net listing A net listing is one in which an owner sets a minimum acceptable amount to be received from the transaction and allows the broker to have any amount received in excess as a commission, assuming the broker has earned a commission according to the other terms of the agreement. The owner's "net" may or may not account for closing costs. For example, a seller requires $750,000 for a property. A broker sells the property for $830,000 and receives the difference, $80,000, as commission. Net listings are generally regarded as unprofessional today, and many states have outlawed them. The argument against the net listing is that it creates a conflict of interest for the broker. It is in the broker's interest to encourage the owner to put the lowest possible acceptable price in the listing, regardless of market value. Thus the agent violates fiduciary duty by failing to place the client's interests above those of the agent.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 161 Exhibit 12.1 Types of Listing</p>
<p>Buyer and tenant agency agreements Buyer and tenant agency agreements create a fiduciary relationship with the buyer or tenant just as seller listings create a fiduciary relationship with the seller. Generally, buyer and tenant representation agreements are subject to the same laws and regulations as those applying to owner listings. Thus:  a representation agreement may be an exclusive, exclusive agency, or open listing. As with owner listings, the most widely used agreement is the exclusive. In this arrangement, the buyer agrees to only work with the buyer representative in procuring a property.  an exclusive listing generally must have an expiration date along with other requirements of a valid listing.  state laws require an exclusive authorization to be in writing Duties of the Agent. At the formation of the relationship, the buyer agent has the duty to explain how buyer or tenant agency relationships work. This is culminated by a signed agreement where the principal understands and accepts these circumstances. During the listing term, the buyer or tenant agent&rsquo;s principal duties are to diligently locate a property that meets the principal&rsquo;s requirements. In addition, the agent must comply with his or her state agency-disclosure laws which may differ from those of traditional listing agents. This involves timely disclosures to prospective sellers and their agents, usually upon initial contact. Transaction broker agreement In terms of agency, a transaction broker is in a non-agency relationship with the seller or buyer. The agent is not bound by fiduciary duties to either party. Nevertheless, transaction brokers enter into binding agreements with buyers and sellers to complete transactions. Such agreements may be exclusive or non- exclusive. Like conventional listings, the transaction brokerage agreement binds the principal to a compensation agreement in the event the broker procures a property or a buyer. Typical agreements affirm the nature of the relationship,</p>
<p>162 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama contain expiration dates, and describe the terms of the agreement, such as the type of property desired or the price a seller deems acceptable.</p>
<p>Like other listing agreements, transaction broker agreements vary among the states where this form of relationship is practiced. Multiple listing A multiple listing is not a distinct listing contract but rather a provision in an exclusive listing authorizing the broker to place the listing into a multiple listing service. A multiple listing service is an organization of member brokers who agree to cooperate in the sale of properties listed by other brokers in exchange for a share of the broker's resulting commission. The authorization enables and requires the broker to disseminate the listing information in a timely fashion so that members in the organization can participate in the sale of the property as subagents. Limited services agreement Rather than provide the full services due a client under a standard listing agreement, a licensee may enter into an agreement to provide limited services selected by the client. The agreement must:  be in writing  disclose that the licensee is acting as a limited service representative  list the specific services the licensee will provide  state the duties of a standard agent that the limited service representative will not provide. Some states require a limited service listing agreement to comply with minimum service requirements.</p>
<h2>FULFILLMENT AND TERMINATION</h2>
<p>Agent's performance Compensation Causes for termination Revoking a listing A listing agreement may terminate in many ways. The only desirable and favorable way is by fulfillment of the contract. Fulfillment results when both parties have performed the actions they have promised to perform. Agent's performance An agent performs a listing agreement by achieving the result specified in the agreement. When and if the result is achieved, the agent's performance is complete. Find a customer or effect a transaction. A listing generally specifies the result to be either finding a customer or effecting a completed transaction.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 163 Finding a customer means locating a party who is ready, willing, and able to transact under the client's terms. Effecting a completed transaction means finding a customer who is not only ready, willing, and able, but one who makes an acceptable offer. A ready, willing, and able customer is one who is:  amenable to the terms of the transaction (ready and willing)  financially capable of paying the price and legally capable of completing the transaction (able)</p>
<p>Specific responsibilities. A listing agreement authorizes a broker to undertake actions relevant to achieving the performance objective. Authorized activities usually include the following:</p>
<p> show or seek property  locate buyer, seller, tenant, or landlord  communicate the client's transaction terms  promote features and advantages of the terms to customers  assist in negotiating a meeting of the minds between parties Due diligence. Due diligence in the listing context refers to verifying the accuracy of the statements in the listing regarding the property, the owner, and the owner's representations. Especially important facts for a broker or agent to verify are:  the property condition  ownership status  the client's authority to act Failure to perform a reasonable degree of due diligence may increase an agent's exposure to liability in the event that the property is not as represented or that the client cannot perform as promised. Delegation of responsibilities. In the normal course of business, a listing broker delegates marketing responsibilities to salespeople. A salesperson may not, however, seek compensation directly from a client. Only the broker can obtain and disburse the compensation. Compensation The main item of performance for the client is payment of compensation, if the agreement calls for it. A broker's compensation is earned and payable when the broker has performed according to the agreement. The amount and structure of the compensation, potential disputes over who has earned compensation, and the client's liability for multiple commissions are other matters that a listing agreement should address. Negotiated compensation. The amount of a broker's commission is whatever amount the client and broker have agreed to. Compensation may be in the form of a percentage of the sale or lease price, or a flat fee. In practice, commissions vary for different geographical areas, types of property and transaction, and services performed.</p>
<p>164 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama Procuring cause. Disputes often arise as to whether an agent is owed a commission. Many such disputes involve open listings where numerous agents are working to find customers for the principal, and none has a clear claim on a commission. In other cases, a client may claim to have found the customer alone and therefore to have no responsibility for paying a commission. There are also situations where cooperating brokers and subagents working under an exclusive listing dispute about which one(s) deserve a share of the listing broker's commission. The concept that decides such disputes is that the party who was the "procuring cause" in finding the customer is entitled to the commission or commission share. The two principal determinants of procuring cause are:  being first to find the customer  being the one who induces the customer to complete the transaction</p>
<p>For example, Broker A and Broker B each have an open listing with a property owner. Broker A shows Joe the property on Monday. Broker B shows Joe the same property on Friday, and then Joe buys the property. Broker A will probably be deemed to be the procuring cause by virtue of having first introduced Joe to the property. Compensation for buyer brokers. Buyer agency agreements stipulate how the agent will be compensated in the relationship. The compensation may be a client- paid retainer fee or a commission contingent upon a completed transaction or procured seller. It is common practice for the agent to be paid by the customer to the transaction, the seller, as opposed to the fiduciary principal, the buyer or tenant. In addition, the agent may be paid by the buyer in the event that the seller or listing agent refuses to offer any compensation to the buyer broker. This might occur, for example, in the case of a for-sale-by-owner transaction. In addition to the form of compensation and the parties responsible for paying the agent, the buyer agency agreement defines when the compensation is in fact earned and will be paid. Customarily, the commission is earned when a sales contract is completed by the transacting parties. The agent may be entitled to compensation even if the buyer defaults on the terms of the sales contract. Normally, agents are paid at closing or upon the buyer&rsquo;s default. Causes for termination A listing may terminate on grounds of:  performance: all parties perform; the intended outcome  infeasibility: it is not possible to perform under the terms of the agreement  mutual agreement: both parties agree to cancel the listing  revocation: either party cancels the listing, with or without the right  abandonment: the broker does not attempt to perform  breach: the terms of the listing are violated  lapse of time: the listing expires  invalidity of contract: the listing does not meet the criteria for validity  incapacitation or death of either party</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 165  involuntary title transfer: condemnation, bankruptcy, foreclosure  destruction of the property Listing expiration regulations. In most states, open listings do not require a stated expiration date. Rather, they expire after a "reasonable" period of time as locally defined. The other types of listing generally must specify a termination date and may not have an automatic renewal mechanism. Courts in many states construe any listing that has no expiration as an open listing. However, some states make these requirements only of written listings, and may not require exclusives to be in writing. Revoking a listing Power vs. right. Both principals to the listing agreement have the power to revoke the contract at any time. They do not, however, always have the right. That is, client or broker may cancel a listing but remain liable for damages to the other party.</p>
<p>Revocation by the client. If the client revokes the listing after the broker has already earned a commission, the client must pay the commission, no matter what type of listing it was. If the broker has not fully performed prior to the revocation, the following guidelines apply:  exclusive right-to-sell: if the property sells during the term of the revoked listing, the client is liable for the commission. If the property does not sell, the client is liable for the broker's actual costs.  exclusive agency: if the property sells during the term of the revoked listing, the client is liable at least for the broker's costs and possibly for the commission. If the property does not sell during the term, the client is liable for the broker's costs.  open: if revoked prior to performance, the client is generally not liable for any payment Revocation by the broker. If the broker cancels the listing or otherwise defaults, the client may sue the broker for money damages.</p>
<h2>LISTING AGREEMENT CLAUSES</h2>
<p>Exclusive right-to-sell clauses Exclusive buyer agency clauses Transaction brokerage clauses A written listing, particularly an exclusive, is a formal contract which contains the entirety of all agreements between the parties. If an agreement is left out, it is assumed not to exist. An agreement that is included is assumed to exist and is generally enforceable. If a written agreement contains mistakes, it is probably not</p>
<p>166 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama valid or enforceable. For these reasons, it is extremely important for a listing agreement to be accurate, error-free, and complete. Students are cautioned to note that listing agreements vary in language and form from state to state. For that reason it is important to ascertain the legal requirements and required clauses for certain types of listings, particularly exclusive listings, in your state. In addition, some states require that if agents use pre-printed forms, such forms must contain certain provisions. Exclusive right- to-sell clauses Requirements for exclusive listing agreements vary from state to state. Generally, a written listing agreement requires as a minimum:  names of all owners  address or legal description of the listed property  listing price  expiration date  commission terms  authority granted The following clause descriptions are found in a typical exclusive right-to- sell listing agreement. Parties and authorization. The agreement should name all legal owners of the property, or duly authorized representatives of the owners, as the client party. It must also name the broker. An authorization clause sets forth the nature of what the broker is allowed to do, i.e., the type of listing. Note that the phrase "right-to-sell" is a misnomer. A broker cannot legally sell the property without proper power of attorney. The usual right is to effect a sale or find a buyer. Real Property. The real property description may include an address, but in some states it must include the legal description. It is critical to identify both the real property and any personal property that are for sale and included in the listing price. Fixtures. Typical agreements list what fixtures are included in the sale specifically, and &ldquo;all other things attached or affixed to the property&rdquo; generally. The seller must then enter which items are excluded from the sale. Personal Property. The listing agreement should include all personal property that is to be included in the transaction and listing price. Listing price. A clause usually sets forth the gross price for the property and possibly the financing terms the owner will accept, particularly if seller financing or assumption of the seller's loan is involved. The listing price is the seller's asking price for the property. This may or may not be the price the seller ultimately accepts. The full listing price does not</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 167 have to be obtained for the broker to earn a commission. The listing price clause may also state the seller's agreement to pay customary closing costs. Listing term. In most states, exclusive listings must have a specific beginning and ending date of the listing agreement. In many states, failure to name a termination date in a written listing is grounds for revocation of the real estate license. Any provision for renewal of the listing term should be very specific. Automatic renewals are illegal in many states. To protect the broker, some listings contain a provision to extend the listing period in the event an expiration occurs during the period in which a sale contract is pending. Agent&rsquo;s duties. This clause specifies the broker's responsibilities and authorization to carry out certain activities. These typically include marketing activities, multiple listing service activities, property access and showings, authority to allow other parties access, permission to inspect existing mortgage financing documents, and authority to accept deposits. Commonly, the clause specifically bars the broker from executing any contract on behalf of the owner.</p>
<p>Agent&rsquo;s compensation. A clause will identify the broker's fee and the necessary conditions for the fee to be earned. For instance, it may state that a commission is earned if a buyer is procured, a contract is executed, or the seller voluntarily transfers the property for any price during the listing period. A fee clause usually provides for remedies in the event of default by the buyer or seller. In effect, if the seller breaches the listing without grounds after a buyer has been procured, the commission is payable. If the owner cannot sell the property for reasons beyond the owner's control, the owner is not liable for a commission. If the buyer breaches a sale contract, the owner and broker may split the buyer's earnest money deposit as liquidated damages, depending on state law. Protection period. Many listings include a protection clause stating that, for a certain period after expiration, the owner is liable for the commission if the property sells to a party that the broker procured, unless the seller has since listed the property with another broker. Multiple listing. This provision obtains the seller's consent to placing the listing in a multiple listing service and authorization to disseminate information about the listing to members. Cooperation with other agents. This clause requires the seller to agree or refuse to cooperate with subagents or buyer agents in selling the property, under what terms, and whether the seller agrees to compensate these parties. Recent agreements stipulate that subagents and buyer agents must disclose their relationships to the buyer upon initial contact and subsequently in writing. There may also be a warning to the seller not to disclose confidential information to a buyer broker insofar as this agent is required to disclose all relevant information to the buyer.</p>
<p>168 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama Non-discrimination. Most exclusive listings contain an affirmation that the agent will conduct all affairs in compliance with state and federal fair housing and nondiscrimination laws. Dual agency. In the absence of disclosure and consent, dual agency represents a conflict of interest for the broker. A good agreement specifically asks the owner to consent to or refuse to allow the broker's representation of both parties. If the clause states that the owner refuses to accept dual agency, the broker agrees not to show the property to any buyers the broker represents. If the seller accepts dual agency, the broker may represent both parties under the restrictions set forth in the listing. The restrictions are generally to protect the confidentialities of either party, particularly those relating to price and terms. Additionally, the broker covenants to deal honestly and impartially with the parties. Other disclosures by agent. In addition to agency, other disclosures might be included to cover any direct or indirect interest the broker has in the transaction and special compensation the broker might be receiving from other parties connected with the transaction.</p>
<p>Seller's representations and promises. In this clause, the owner represents that he or she in fact owns the property in the manner stated in the listing, and is legally capable of delivering fee simple, marketable title.</p>
<p>The clause may further require the owner to warrant that he or she  is not represented by another party and will not list the property elsewhere during the listing period  will not lease the property during the listing period without approval  agrees to provide necessary information  will refer all prospects directly to the broker without prior direct negotiation  has reviewed a sample &ldquo;Offer to Purchase and Sell&rdquo; contract  will make the property presentable and available for showing at reasonable times upon notice by agent.</p>
<p>Seller's property condition disclosure. Most current listing forms require the seller to disclose the condition of the property to prospective buyers. New laws in most states allow buyers to cancel a sale contract if they have not received the seller's property condition disclosure before closing or occupancy or other deadline. In addition, the listing may include among the seller&rsquo;s duties the requirement to complete and provide the agent with a Lead Paint Hazard addendum. A copy of the required notice to buyers may be attached to the listing agreement as part of the agreement.</p>
<p>Seller&rsquo;s title and deed. A provision usually requires the owner to promise to deliver good and marketable title, title insurance, and to convey the property</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 169 using a general warranty deed to a buyer. Without this covenant, the broker has no assurance that a transaction will occur, and in turn that he or she will be paid for procuring a buyer.</p>
<p>Flood hazard insurance. This clause requires the seller to disclose whether he or she is required to or presently maintains flood insurance on the property.</p>
<p>Limitation of liability. There is often a clause requiring the owner to indemnify the broker against liability resulting from casualty, loss, and owner misrepresentation during the listing period.</p>
<p>In practice, liability and indemnification clauses do not necessarily absolve a broker from liability.</p>
<p>Escrow authorization. The seller authorizes escrow officers to disburse earned commission funds to the broker upon the broker's instructions to do so.</p>
<p>IRS requirements; alien seller withholding. A clause may state that the seller will comply with IRS requirements for providing tax-related information. This ensures that a seller who is an alien understands that a buyer will be required to withhold a percentage of the sale price for the IRS.</p>
<p>Other listing provisions. An exclusive listing might also provide for:  mediation: in the event of a dispute, the owner agrees to arbitrate differences before filing a lawsuit  attorney fees: the losing party in a lawsuit must pay court costs and attorney fees  acknowledgment: the owner acknowledges reading and understanding the agreement  entire agreement: the listing cannot be changed without written agreement; the listing sets forth all agreements made  binding effect: listing is binding and enforceable  saving clause: if a portion of the agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the balance of the agreement remains valid as permitted by law Notices to owner. Some listing agreements include notices to the seller concerning:  fee negotiability: the broker's fee is the result of negotiations with the seller  fair housing laws: the broker and seller must comply with discrimination laws  keyboxes; security: the seller should take prudent measures to protect personal property and remove dangerous items that could cause injury  legal advice disclaimer: the broker cannot give legal advice Signatures. All owners and the broker must sign the listing and indicate the date of signing.</p>
<p>170 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama Exclusive buyer agency clauses The exclusive buyer agency agreement is very similar to the exclusive right-to- sell agreement, the only significant differences being the agent&rsquo;s objectives and the fact that the principal is the buyer instead of the seller. The notable exception is how the agent is paid, as previously discussed. The clauses which are virtually identical to the exclusive right-to-sell are:  the identity of the principal and the agent&rsquo;s authorized activity  the description of the property desired in terms of location, price, size, etc.  the term of the agreement and its automatic termination  the buyer&rsquo;s agreement to work exclusively through the agent  the agent&rsquo;s duties to locate a suitable property according to the buyer&rsquo;s specifications  the non-discrimination clause  signatures of the parties The following clauses distinguish the buyer agency agreement from the exclusive right-to sell agreement.</p>
<p>Buyer&rsquo;s representation of exclusivity. Here the buyer affirms that he or she is not represented by another agent. In addition the buyer acknowledges an understanding of the agency relationship. Agent compensation. This clause sets forth how the agent is to be paid, whether by retainer or commission, who is to pay the commission, and what the buyer owes the agent in the event the seller does not participate in the agent&rsquo;s compensation. Second, the clause establishes the circumstances under which the agent has earned the commission. This includes finding a property during the agreement term or the buyer contracting to buy a property shown by the agent within a stipulated period of time following expiration. In addition, the clause provides that the agent will be paid in the event the buyer defaults on a sale contract. Other buyers acknowledged. In this provision, the buyer acknowledges that the agent is working with other buyers who may be in competition for any property the buyer is shown by the agent. Transaction brokerage clauses Transaction brokerage agreements vary greatly among the states where this brokerage relationship is practiced. The agreement may be exclusive or non- exclusive. Despite the lack of standardization and uniformity, these agreements contain the following principal provisions. Parties and property identification. The agreement identifies the principals and if a seller, the description of the property to be sold, or if a buyer a description of the property desired. Agent&rsquo;s authorized activity. This clause gives the agent the exclusive right and authority to sell or locate property for the principal.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Listing Agreements: An Overview 171 Non-agency declaration. The agreement clearly sets forth that it is a non-agency personal services contract with a legally binding effect. This provision expressly states that the broker is not an agent of the buyer or seller and is not acting in a fiduciary capacity. In addition, the principal agrees that the agent is not working for the benefit of either party nor advocating the interests of either party. Usually this clause requires the principal&rsquo;s acknowledgment that he or she has read a state-level approved document describing and explaining the forms of agency or non-agency relationships practiced in that state. Transaction broker duties. Like other listings, this clause defines what activities the agent will undertake to earn compensation. Key words are &lsquo;assist,&rsquo; or &lsquo;offer information&rsquo; or &lsquo;facilitate&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;represent.&rsquo; Activities include web searches, showings, advertising, etc. Other buyers acknowledged. If a buyer agreement, the buyer will acknowledge that the agent is working with other buyers who may be in competition for any property the buyer is shown by the agent. Compensation. This clause stipulates what the agent will be paid, by whom, and upon what circumstances, much like the buyer agency agreement. The clause will likely include that the compensation may be partially or wholly provided by the seller. In addition, the clause provides that, if the buyer purchases a property that was previously shown by the agent within a certain amount of time following the listing&rsquo;s expiration date, then the agent is owed the commission. Buyer or seller duties. Here the agreement states what the buyer or seller commits to do during the listing term, most notably to compensate the agent for fulfilling the agreement. In addition, the seller typically agrees to show the property, and provide property condition disclosures. The buyer agrees to work exclusively with the agent (if an exclusive agreement) and provide information regarding the desired property and certain financial information. Agreement term. Like other listings, the transaction agreement contains a beginning and ending date for the listing term. The term is extendable to closing if the principal buys or sells a property for which the settlement date is beyond the original expiration date. Non-discrimination. The agreement affirms that the agent will conduct all affairs in compliance with state and federal fair housing and non-discrimination laws. Signatures of parties. The signatures of the principal and agent affirm the agreement as well as acknowledge that the principal has received a copy of the agreement.</p>
