When a borrower\ngives a note promising to repay the borrowed money and executes a mortgage on\nthe real estate for which the money is being borrowed as security, the financing\nmethod is called mortgage financing. The term \"mortgage financing\" also applies\nto real estate loans secured by a deed of trust. The process of securing a loan by\npledging a property without giving up ownership of the property is called\nhypothecation.\nStates differ in their interpretation of who owns mortgaged property. Those that\nregard the mortgage as a lien held by the mortgagee (lender) against the property\nowned by the mortgagor (borrower) are called lien-theory states. Those that\nregard the mortgage document as a conveyance of ownership from the mortgagor\nto the mortgagee are called title-theory states. Some states interpret ownership of\nmortgaged property from a point of view that combines aspects of both title and\nlien theory.\nA valid mortgage or trust deed financing arrangement requires\n\uf034 a note as evidence of the debt\n\uf034 the mortgage or trust deed as evidence of the collateral pledge\nNote. In addition to executing a mortgage or trust deed, the borrower signs a\npromissory note for the amount borrowed. The amount of the loan is typically the\ndifference between the purchase price and the down payment. A promissory note\ncreates a personal liability for the borrower to repay the loan.\nChapter 17: Real Estate Finance 249",

The mortgage document pledges\nthe borrower's ownership interest in the real estate in question as collateral\nagainst performance of the debt obligation.\nThe flow of funds and obligations in a mortgage transaction is as follows:\nExhibit 17.1 Flow of a Mortgage Transaction\nInitiation\nNote & mortgage\nMortgagor Mortgagee\nLoan amount\nFulfillment\nPayments\nMortgagor\nMortgagee\nCancellation of\nnote & mortgage\nThe deed of trust. A deed of trust conveys title to the property in question from\nthe borrower (trustor) to a trustee as security for the loan. The trustee is a third\nparty fiduciary to the trust. While the loan is in place, the trustee holds the title\non behalf of the lender, who is the beneficiary of the trust. On repayment of the\nloan, the borrower receives the title from the trustee in the form of a deed of\nreconveyance.\nThe flow of funds and obligations in a trust deed transaction is as follows:\n250 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The capital amount borrowed, on which interest payments are\ncalculated, is the original loan principal. In an amortizing loan, part of the\nprincipal is repaid periodically along with interest, so that the principal balance\ndecreases over the life of the loan. At any point during the life of a mortgage\nloan, the remaining unpaid principal is called the loan balance, or remaining\nbalance.\nInterest and interest rate. Interest is a charge for the use of the lender's money.\nInterest may be paid in advance at the beginning of the payment period, or in\narrears at the end of the payment period, according to the terms of the note.\nMortgage interest is most commonly paid in arrears. The interest rate is a\npercentage applied to the principal to determine the amount of interest due. The\nrate may be fixed for the term of the loan, or it may be variable, according to the\nterms of the note. A loan with a fixed interest rate is called a fixed-rate loan; a\nloan with a variable interest rate is commonly called an adjustable rate loan.\nBecause the interest rate on a mortgage loan does not reflect the full cost of the\nloan to the borrower, federal law requires a lender on a residential property to\ncompute and disclose an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) that includes other\nfinance charges in addition to the basic interest rate in the calculation.\nChapter 17: Real Estate Finance 251",

    "text": "Many states have laws against usury, which is the charging of excessive interest\nrates on loans. Such states have a maximum rate that is either a flat rate or a\nvariable rate tied to an index such as the prime lending rate.\nPoints. From the point of view of a lender or investor, the amount loaned in a\nmortgage loan is the lender's capital investment, and the interest paid by the\nborrower is the return earned by the invested capital. It is often the case that a\nlender needs to earn a greater return than the interest rate alone provides. For\nexample, a lender may require additional yield on a low-interest VA loan which\nhas an interest rate maximum. In such a case, the lender charges up-front\ndiscount points to make up the difference between the interest rate on the loan\nand the required return. This effectively raises the yield of the loan to the lender.\nA discount point is one percent of the loan amount. Thus, one point on a\n$100,000 loan equals $1,000. The lender charges this as pre-paid interest at\nclosing by funding only the face amount of the loan minus the discount points.\nThe borrower, however, must repay the full loan amount, along with interest\ncalculated on the full amount.\nThe value of one discount point to a lender is usually estimated to be equivalent\nto raising the interest rate on the loan by 1/8%. Thus, a lender has to charge eight\npoints to raise the yield by 1%. If a lender needs to earn 7% on a loan offered at\n6.5%, the number of points necessary would be figured as follows:\n7.0% - 6.5% = .5%\n.5% x 8 (points per 1%) = 4 points\nOn a loan of $100,000, the 4 points would cost the borrower:\n100,000 x .04 = $4,000.\nThe borrower would effectively receive from the lender $96,000, and owe\nprincipal and interest based on $100,000. For tax reasons, it is usually advisable\nfor the borrower to receive the full loan amount from the lender and pay the\npoints in a check which is separate from that used for other closing costs. As pre-\npaid interest, points paid in this way may be deductible on the borrower's income\ntax return for the year of the purchase. The borrower should seek the advice of a\ntax consultant concerning this matter.\nTerm. The loan term is the period of time over which the loan must be repaid. A\n\"30-year loan\" is a loan whose balance must be fully paid off at the end of thirty\nyears. A \"five-year balloon loan\" is a loan whose balance must be paid off at the\nend of five years, although its payments may be calculated on a term of another\nlength, such as fifteen or thirty years. Such a loan is also sometimes described as\na 30-year loan with a five-year \"call.\"\nPayments. The loan term, loan amount, and interest rate combine to determine\nthe periodic payment amount. When these three quantities are known, it is\npossible to identify the periodic payment from a mortgage table or with a\nfinancial calculator. Mortgage payments are usually made on a monthly basis.\nOn an amortizing loan, a portion of the payment goes to repay the loan balance\nin advance, and a portion goes to payment of interest in arrears.\n252 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "For example, Mary and Jerry King borrow $400,000 to finance the purchase of a\nhome. The loan has a term of thirty years at an interest rate of 5% and is\namortizing. The monthly payment for this loan will be $2,147. For the first\npayment at the end of the month, the Kings owe interest on $400,000 for the\nmonthly period. At 5%, this amounts to $1,666.67. Since their payment is $2,147\nand the interest charge is $1,666.67, the difference, which is $480.33, is applied to\nan advance payment of principal. The following month, the Kings will pay interest\non the new, smaller loan balance of $399,519.67 ($400,000.00 \u2013 480.33).\nIf a borrower pays more than the scheduled payment amount, the excess is\ncredited to repayment of the principal, which is reduced by the amount of the\nexcess payment. The required minimum payment amount remains constant for\nthe life of the loan, but the loan term can be reduced by this means, thereby also\nreducing the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.\nPromissory note A borrower who executes a promissory note is the maker or payer of the note.\nThe lender is the payee. To be properly executed, all parties who have an interest\nin the property should sign the note. The note sets forth:\n\uf034 the loan amount\n\uf034 the term of the loan\n\uf034 the method and timing of repayment\n\uf034 the interest rate to be paid\n\uf034 the borrower's promise to pay\nThe note may also state that it is payable to the bearer, if used with a deed of\ntrust, or to the mortgagee, if used with a mortgage. Other items in the mortgage\ndocument or deed of trust may be repeated in the promissory note, especially:\n\uf034 the right to prepay the loan balance\n\uf034 charges for late payment\n\uf034 conditions for default\n\uf034 notifications and cures for default\n\uf034 other charges\nA promissory note is a negotiable instrument, which means the payee may\nassign it to a third party. The assignee would then have the right to receive the\nborrower's periodic payments.\nMortgage document\nand trust deed A borrower who executes a mortgage is a mortgagor. The lender named in the\nmortgage is the mortgagee. In a trust deed, the borrower is the trustor and the\nlender is beneficiary. The mortgage or trust document identifies the property\nbeing given as security, giving both its legal description and mailing address. The\ndocument contains much of the same information as the note, including:\n\uf034 the debt amount\n\uf034 the term of the loan\n\uf034 method and timing of payments\nThe document does not usually provide details about the payment amount,\ninterest rate, or charges.\nChapter 17: Real Estate Finance 253",

    "text": "Among the major clauses of a typical mortgage are the following.\nPayment of Principal and Interest: Prepayment and Late Charges. The\nborrower must make timely payments according to the terms of the note.\nFunds for Taxes and Insurance. Unless waived by the lender or prohibited by\nlaw, the borrower must make monthly payments to cover taxes and hazard\ninsurance. If applicable, the borrower must also pay flood insurance and\nmortgage insurance installments.\nPeriodic payments of taxes and insurance are held in a reserve fund called the\nescrow account. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) limits the\namount of funds that the lender can require and hold for this purpose.\nThe borrower's monthly payment to the lender for principal and interest is called\nthe P&I payment (principal and interest). The amount which also includes the\nescrow payment is called PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance).\nApplication of Payments. The amount of each payment is applied to various\nitems in order of priority. Unless local law provides otherwise, this order is: 1)\nprepayment charges; 2) escrow; 3) interest; 4) principal; 5) late charges.\nCharges and Liens. The borrower is liable for paying any charges, liens, or other\nexpenses that may have priority over the mortgage or trust instrument.\nHazard or Property Insurance. The borrower must keep the property insured as\nthe lender requires to protect the lender\u2019s collateral. Homeowners\u2019 insurance\npolicies typically provide coverage for losses due to fire, lightning, wind, hail,\nexplosions, glass breakage, smoke, riots, vandalism, theft, and other perils.\nInsurance proceeds, in case of a claim, are applied first to restoring the property,\nor, if that is not feasible, to payment of the debt.\nOccupancy, Preservation, Maintenance and Protection of the Property. The\nborrower must take and maintain occupancy of the property as the borrower's\nprincipal residence according to the lender's requirements. The borrower must not\nuse or neglect the property in such a way as to impair the lender's lien on the\nproperty. This could include using the property for illegal purposes, creating\nhazardous waste on the property, or destroying the improvements.\nProtection of Lender's Rights in the Property. The lender may take actions it\nbelieves are necessary to protect its rights in the property if the borrower's actions\nthreaten them. The costs of these actions would be charged to the borrower, and\nbecome part of the monthly payment.\nMortgage Insurance. The lender may require the borrower to obtain private\nmortgage insurance, or PMI. Mortgage insurance protects the lender against\nloss of a portion of the loan (typically 20-25%) in case of borrower default.\nPrivate mortgage insurance generally applies to loans that are not backed by the\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) or Veterans Administration (VA) and\nthat have a down payment of less than 20% of the property value.\n254 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

If the property is condemned or taken by eminent domain, the\nlender declares a claim on any resulting proceeds.\nBorrower Not Released; Forbearance by Lender Not a Waiver. The lender\nreserves the right to take future action against the borrower for default, even if\nthe lender decides not to take immediate action. If the lender agrees to change the\nterms of the loan, it does not release the borrower from the original liability.\nTransfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. If the borrower\nsells or transfers its interest in the property without the lender's approval, the\nlender may demand immediate and full repayment of the loan balance. This is an\nalienation clause, also known as a due-on-sale clause and a call clause. It allows\nthe lender to prevent the assumption of the mortgage by a buyer if the borrower\nsells the property. The requirement to repay the loan before the scheduled date is\ncalled acceleration.\nBorrower's Right to Reinstate. If the lender holds the borrower in default\nunder the terms of the mortgage and proceeds to enforce its rights under the\ndocument, such as by foreclosing, the borrower has the right to reinstate his or\nher interest by performing certain actions. This usually means paying overdue\nmortgage payments and any other expenses the lender may have incurred in\nprotecting its rights. The clause, also known as a redemption clause, gives the\nborrower a period of time to satisfy obligations and prevent the lender from\nforcing a sale of the property. See foreclosure on page 68 in Chapter Five.\nRelease. The lender agrees to release the mortgage or trust document to the\nborrower when the borrower has paid off the loan and all other sums secured by\nthe document. The release clause, also known as a defeasance clause, may\nspecify that the mortgagee will execute a satisfaction of mortgage (also known\nas release of mortgage and mortgage discharge) to the mortgagor. In the case\nof a deed of trust, the lender as beneficiary requests the trustee to execute a\nrelease deed or deed of reconveyance to the borrower as trustor. The release\ndeed or satisfaction should be recorded as necessary in county records to show\nthat the mortgagee/trustee has extinguished all liens against the property.\nINITIATING A MORTGAGE LOAN\nThe loan application\nMortgage loan underwriting\nThe process of initiating a mortgage loan begins when a borrower completes a\nloan application and submits it to a lender for evaluation by the lender's\nunderwriters.\nThe loan application Forms.

The application must be complete for the lender to consider it. The\nform must be signed and dated by the applicant(s) and delivered to the lending\ninstitution. The initiation of the application process occurs when the lender\nreceives the completed application package from the applicant. Federal law\nrequires the lender to accept all applications and to give applicants notice\nconcerning the disposition of the application. If the lender denies the loan\napplication because of fraudulent information on the application form, the\nborrower has no claim to a refund of the application fee.\nMortgage loan\nunderwriting Loan underwriting is the process of assessing the lender's risk in giving a loan.\nMortgage underwriting includes:\n\uf034 evaluating the borrower's ability to repay the loan\n\uf034 appraising the value of the property offered as security\n\uf034 determining the terms of the loan\nRisk. A lender undertakes a number of risks in lending money. The principal\nrisks are that the borrower will default on repayment of the loan, and that the\nborrower will damage the value of the property as security. In addition, the\nlender runs the risk that, in the event of a foreclosure, the sales proceeds from\nthe property will be insufficient to cover the lender's loss.\nQualification. A lender assesses risks by examining, or qualifying, both\nborrower and property. In qualifying a borrower, an underwriter weighs the\nability of the borrower to repay the loan. This requires an analysis of whether the\nborrower's income, cash resources, creditworthiness, net worth, and employment\nstability meet the lender's standards.\nLoan-to-value ratio, or LTV. In qualifying a property, an underwriter assesses\nthe ability of the property value to cover potential losses. In this evaluation, a\nlender requires that the appraised value of the property be more than adequate to\n256 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "cover the contemplated loan and costs. To protect further against loss, a lender\nwill usually lend only a portion of the property's value. The relationship of the\nloan amount to the property value, expressed as a percentage, is called the loan-\nto-value ratio, or LTV. If the lender's loan to value ratio is 80%, the lender will\nlend only $80,000 on a home appraised at $100,000. The difference between\nwhat the lender will lend and what the borrower must pay for the property is the\namount the borrower must provide in cash as a down payment.\nEven if borrower and property qualify, a lender may, under certain\ncircumstances, seek further protection against risk by requiring the borrower to\nobtain private mortgage insurance. This is frequently the case with loans\nrequiring a relatively small down payment, leading to a high loan-to-value ratio.\nPrivate mortgage insurance. As mentioned earlier, if a loan's LTV ratio is too\nhigh, a lender may require that the borrower purchase private mortgage insurance,\ncommonly called PMI. This insurance secures whatever portion of the loan\namount takes the LTV ratio above the typical ratio limit \u2013 which is usually 80% of\nthe property's value. This protects the lender from the borrower's default \u2013 which\ncan become more likely if the borrower has very little equity in the property.\nTo illustrate, take a $500,000 property with an 90-10% LTV loan on it. At 90%,\nthis loan would be 90% times $500,000, or $450,000. Next, consider that the\nlender requires 20% equity, or an 80-20% LTV. Such an LTV would cap the loan\nlimit at $400,000. In this case, to get this lender to lend $450,000, the borrower\nwould have to purchase PMI to insure the \"top\" portion of the loan, or $50,000.\nWith this PMI safety net, the lender can lend the funds, and the borrower closes\nwith a 90-10 LTV loan.\nIn practice, a borrower who has to obtain PMI must retain the insurance policy\nand continue the premium payments until the LTV ratio on the loan has dropped\nto within acceptable levels, such as the 80-20 level. This happens by the\nproperty's value appreciating as well as the loan balance being paid off over time.\nFinally, if the borrower can assimilate enough funds to pay down the loan balance,\nthe lender will be obligated to drop the PMI requirement, since, as we have seen, a\nprepayment of principal changes the loan-to-value ratio.\nQUALIFYING FOR A MORTGAGE LOAN\nEqual Credit Opportunity Act\nIncome qualification\nLoan constant\nCash qualification\nNet worth\nCredit evaluation\nLoan commitment\nTo qualify for a mortgage loan, a borrower must meet the lender's qualifications\nin terms of income, debt, cash, and net worth.

In addition, ECOA has prohibited a number of practices in mortgage\nloan underwriting. Accordingly, a lender may not:\n\uf034 discount or disregard income from part-time work, a spouse, child\nsupport, alimony, or separate maintenance. Further, the loan\nofficer may not ask whether any of the applicant's income is\nderived from these sources.\n\uf034 assume that income for a certain type of person will be reduced\nbecause of an employment interruption due to child-bearing or\nchild-raising.

If some of a borrower's cash for\nthe down payment comes as a gift from a relative or friend, a lender may require\na gift letter from the donor stating the amount of the gift and lack of any\nrequirement to repay the gift. On the other hand, if someone is lending an\napplicant a portion of the down payment with a provision for repayment, a lender\nwill consider this another debt obligation and adjust the debt ratio accordingly.\nThis can lower the amount a lender is willing to lend.\nNet worth An applicant's net worth shows a lender the depth of the applicant's cash\nreserves, the value and liquidity of assets, and the extent to which assets\nexceed liabilities. These facts are important to a lender as an indication of the\napplicant's ability to sustain debt payment in the event of loss of employment.\nCredit evaluation Credit report and credit score.

Credit scoring is a computer-based method\nof assigning a numerical value to an applicant's credit. The credit score is a\nstatistical prediction of a borrower's likelihood of defaulting on a loan.\nLoan commitment When a lender's underwriters have qualified an applicant and the lender has\ndecided to offer the loan, the lender gives the applicant a written notice of the\nagreement to lend under specific terms.

This money may become available through the process of\nintermediation, in which funds on deposit with financial institutions are loaned\nout to borrowers, or disintermediation, in which the owners of the savings invest\ntheir money directly by making loans or other investments. Government actions\nand investor activities affect the supply of money for mortgage loans and\nencourage or discourage the market for mortgage loans as an investment.\nSupply and demand\nfor money Money is a limited commodity subject to the effects of supply and demand. The\nfederal government's monetary policy controls the supply of money in order to\nachieve the country's economic goals. An excessive supply of money usually\ncauses interest rates to fall and consumer prices to rise. Conversely, an excessive\ndemand for money, such as for mortgage loans, causes interest rates to rise and\nprices to fall. Regulation of the money supply addresses these fluctuations with\nthe aim to control and limit wide swings in the supply and demand cycle. These\nefforts, in turn, help to buffer the economy from severe inflationary or\nrecessionary trends.\nRegulating the money supply. The Federal Reserve System regulates the money\nsupply by means of three methods:\n\uf034 selling or re-purchasing government securities, primarily\nTreasury bills\n\uf034 changing the reserve requirement for member banks. The\nreserve is a percentage of depositors' funds that banks and other\nregulated financial institutions may not lend out.\n\uf034 changing the interest rate, or discount rate, the system charges\nmember institutions for borrowing funds from the Federal\nReserve System central banks\nWhen the Federal Reserve sells Treasury bills, the money paid for the securities\nis removed from the economy's money supply. Conversely, when it repurchases\nTreasury bills, the cash paid out to investors puts money back into the economy.\nThe second control, regulating reserve requirements, effectively restricts how\nmuch money banks can put into the economy through the disbursement of loans.\nWhen the Federal Reserve raises reserve requirements, banks have less money to\nlend, decreasing the money supply. When the Fed lowers reserve requirements,\nbanks have more money to lend, increasing the money supply.\nThe third control, and perhaps the most effective, is regulation of the discount\nrate which member banks must pay to borrow money. If the discount rate goes\nup, it becomes more cost-prohibitive to borrow. Therefore the money supply\ntightens. If the discount rate is lowered, banks have an incentive to borrow more\nmoney to lend to customers.\nThe primary\nmortgage market The primary mortgage market consists of lenders who originate mortgage\nloans directly to borrowers. Primary mortgage market lenders include:\n\uf034 savings and loans\n\uf034 commercial banks\n\uf034 mutual savings banks\n268 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Rather, they are instrumental in procuring\nborrowers for primary mortgage lenders.\nThe primary lender assumes the initial risk of the long-term investment in the\nmortgage loan. Primary lenders sometimes also service the loan until it is paid\noff. Servicing loans entails collecting the borrower's periodic payments,\nmaintaining and disbursing funds in escrow accounts for taxes and insurance,\nsupervising the borrower's performance, and releasing the mortgage on\nrepayment. In many cases, primary lenders employ mortgage servicing\ncompanies, which service loans for a fee.\nPortfolio lenders. A primary mortgage market lender may or may not sell its\nloans into the secondary market. Many lenders originate loans for the purpose of\nretaining the investments in their own loan portfolio. These loans are referred to\nas portfolio loans, and lenders originating loans for their own portfolio are called\nportfolio lenders. Portfolio lenders are less restricted by the standards and forms\nimposed on other lenders by secondary market organizations. In retaining their\nportfolio loans, portfolio lenders may vary underwriting criteria and hold\nindependent standards for down payment requirements and the condition of the\ncollateral.\nThe secondary\nmortgage market Lenders, investors and government agencies that buy loans already originated by\nsomeone else, or originate loans indirectly through someone else, constitute the\nsecondary mortgage market.\nSecondary mortgage market organizations include:\n\uf034 Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie\nMae)\n\uf034 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, or Freddie\nMac)\n\uf034 Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie\nMae)\n\uf034 investment firms that assemble loans into packages and sell\nsecurities based on the pooled mortgages\n\uf034 life insurance companies\n\uf034 pension funds\n\uf034 primary market institutions who also invest as secondary lenders\nSecondary mortgage market organizations buy pools of mortgages from primary\nlenders and sell securities backed by these pooled mortgages to investors.

    "text": "TYPES OF REAL ESTATE LOANS\nConventional loans\nFHA-insured loans\nVA-guaranteed loans\nCommon loan structures\nSeller financing\nSpecial-purpose loans\nConventional loans A conventional mortgage loan is a permanent long-term loan that is not FHA-\ninsured or VA-guaranteed. Market rates usually determine the interest rate on\nthe loan. Because of the lack of insurance or guarantee by a government\nagency, the risk to a lender is greater for a conventional loan than for a non-\nconventional loan. This risk is usually reflected in higher interest rates and\nstricter requirements for the down payment and the borrower's income\nqualification. At the same time, conventional loans allow greater flexibility in\nfees, rates, and terms than do insured and guaranteed loans.\nThe primary sources of conventional loans are banks and savings and loan\nassociations. Other conventional lenders include credit unions, life insurance\ncompanies, pension funds, mortgage bankers, and private individuals.\nVarious types of lenders specialize in mortgage lending for specific purposes\nand type of borrower, such as commercial, construction, or single-family\nresidential loans.\nFHA-insured loans The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is an agency of the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (HUD). It does not lend money, but insures\npermanent long-term loans made by others. The lender must be approved by the\nFHA, and the borrower must meet certain FHA qualifications. In addition, the\nproperty used to secure the loan must meet FHA standards. The FHA insures that\nthe lender will not suffer significant loss in the case of borrower default. To\nprovide this security, FHA provides insurance and charges the borrower an\ninsurance premium. FHA loans typically have a higher loan-to-value ratio than\nconventional loans, enabling a borrower to make a smaller down payment.\nThe basic FHA-insured loan program is the Title II, Section 203(b) program for\nloans on one- to four-family residential properties. Among the features of this\nprogram are the following.\nFHA mortgage insurance. The FHA determines how much mortgage insurance\nmust be provided and charges the borrower an appropriate mortgage insurance\npremium (MIP). The initial premium is payable at closing or is added to the\nborrower's loan balance and financed. Further annual premiums are charged\nmonthly. The amount of the premium varies according to the loan term and the\napplicable loan-to-value ratio.\nBorrower default. The FHA reimburses the lender for losses due to default by\nthe borrower, including costs of foreclosure.\nAppraisal. The property must be appraised by an FHA-approved appraiser. The\nproperty must also meet the FHA's standards for type and quality of construction,\nneighborhood quality, and other features.\n272 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Maximum loan amount. The FHA has set maximum loan amounts for over 80\nregions. Borrowers within a region are limited to the loan ceiling amount in effect\nfor the region. In addition, the maximum loan amount is restricted by the loan-to-\nvalue ratios in effect. The maximum FHA-backed loan a borrower can obtain will\nbe the lesser of the regional ceiling amount or the amount dictated by the loan-to-\nvalue standard. Calculations are based on the lesser of sale price or appraised\nvalue.\nDown payment requirement. The minimum down payment for an FHA-backed\nloan is based on the lower of the appraised value or the sales price. The present\nrequirement for single-family residential loans is 3.5%.\nMaximum loan term. Thirty years is the maximum length of the repayment\nperiod.\nPrepayment privilege. The borrower has the right to pay off the loan at any time\nwithout penalty, provided the lender is given prior notice. The lender may charge\nup to 30 days' interest if the borrower provides less than 30 days' notice.\nAssumability. FHA-backed loans on owner-occupied properties are assumable if\nthe buyer is qualified. Lenders and borrowers should check with FHA for current\nrequirements.\nInterest rate. The lender and borrower negotiate the interest rate on an FHA-\nbacked loan without any involvement by FHA.\nPoints, fees and costs. The lender may charge discount points, a loan origination\nfee, and other such charges. These may be paid by buyer or seller. However, if\nthe seller pays more than a specified percentage of the costs normally paid by a\nbuyer, the FHA may regard these as sales concessions and lower the sales price\non which the loan insurance amount is based.\nIn addition to Section 203(b) loan programs, FHA offers insurance coverage for\nother loan products. These include:\n\uf034 home improvement loans\n\uf034 subsidized loans for low- and middle-income families\n\uf034 loans for condominiums\n\uf034 loans for multi-family projects\n\uf034 graduated-payment loans\n\uf034 adjustable-rate loans\nVA-guaranteed\nloans The Department of Veterans Affairs (formerly Veterans Administration) offers\nloan guarantees to qualified veterans. The VA, like the FHA, does not lend\nmoney except in certain areas where other financing is not generally available.\nInstead, the VA partially guarantees permanent long-term loans originated by\nVA-approved lenders on properties that meet VA standards. The VA's guarantee\nenables lenders to issue loans with higher loan-to-value ratios than would\notherwise be possible. The interest rate on a VA-guaranteed loan is usually lower\nthan one on a conventional loan. The borrower does not pay any premium for the\nloan guarantee, but does pay a VA funding fee at closing.\nChapter 17: Real Estate Finance 273",

    "text": "Borrower default. The VA reimburses the lender for losses up to the guaranteed\namount if foreclosure sale proceeds fail to cover the loan balance.\nAppraisal. The property must be appraised by a VA-approved appraiser. The VA\nissues a Certificate of Reasonable Value which creates a maximum value on\nwhich the VA-guaranteed portion of the loan will be based. The property must\nmeet certain VA specifications.\nDown payment requirement. The VA usually requires no down payment,\nalthough the lender may require one.\nMaximum loan amount. The VA does not cap the loan amount, but it does limit\nthe liability it can assume, which usually influences the amount an institution will\nlend. The amount a qualified veteran with full entitlement can borrow without\nmaking a downpayment determines the practical loan limits. This amount varies\nby county. The basic entitlement available to each eligible veteran is $36,000.\nLenders will generally lend a maximum of 4 times that amount without a down\npayment if the veteran is fully qualified and the property appraises for the asking\nprice.\nA veteran must apply for a Certificate of Eligibility to find out how much the VA\nwill guarantee in a particular situation.\nMaximum loan term. The maximum loan term for one- to four-family residences\nis 30 years. For loans secured by farms, the maximum loan term is 40 years.\nPrepayment privilege. The loan may be paid off early without penalty.\nAssumability. VA loans are assumable with lender approval. Usually, the person\nassuming the loan must have VA eligibility, and the assumption may have to be\napproved by the VA.\nInterest rate. Lender and borrower negotiate the interest rate for all VA-insured\nloans.\nPoints, fees and costs. The lender may charge discount points, origination fees,\nand other reasonable costs. These may be paid by seller (with some limits) or\nbuyer, but may not be financed. The VA funding fee, however, may be included\nin the loan amount. The funding fee is a percentage of the loan amount which\nvaries based on the type of loan, military category, whether the loan is a first-time\nloan, and whether there is a down payment.\nOther VA programs. In addition to insuring loans to veterans, the VA may\ninsure loans for lenders who set up a special account with the VA. The VA may\nalso actually lend money directly when an eligible veteran cannot find other\nmortgage money locally.\nCommon loan\nstructures Variations in the structure of interest rate, term, payments, and principal payback\nproduce a number of commonly recognized loan types. Among these are the\nfollowing.\nAmortizing loan. Amortization provides for gradual repayment of principal and\npayment of interest over the term of the loan. The borrower's periodic payments\nto the lender include a portion for interest and a portion for principal. In a fully\namortizing mortgage, the principal balance is zero at the end of the term.

    "text": "partially amortizing loan, the payments are not sufficient to retire the debt. At the\nend of the loan term, there is still a principal balance to be paid off.\nNegatively amortized loan. Negative amortization causes the loan\nbalance to increase over the term. This occurs if the borrower's periodic\npayment is insufficient to cover the interest owed for the period. The\nlender adds the amount of unpaid interest to the borrower's loan balance.\nTemporary negative amortization occurs on graduated payment loans,\nand may occur on an adjustable rate mortgage.\nAdjustable and fixed rate loans. Loans may have fixed or variable rates of\ninterest over the loan term. Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) allow the lender\nto change the interest rate at specified intervals and by a specified amount.\nFederal regulations place limits, called rate caps, on incremental interest rate\nincreases and on the total amount by which the rate may be increased over the\nloan term.\nSenior and junior loans. When there are multiple loans on a single property,\nthere is an order of priority in the liens which the mortgages create. The first, or\nsenior, loan generally has priority over any subsequent loans. Second loans are\nriskier than first loans because the senior lender will be satisfied first in case of\ndefault. Therefore, interest rates on second mortgages are generally higher than\non first mortgages.\nFixed and graduated payment loans. Loans may have variable payment\namounts over the term of the loan, or a single fixed payment amount. With a\ngraduated payment mortgage, the payments at the beginning of the loan term are\nnot sufficient to amortize the loan fully, and unpaid interest is added to the\nprincipal balance. Payments are later adjusted to a level that will fully amortize\nthe loan's increased balance over the remaining loan term.\nInterest-only loan. In an interest-only loan, periodic payments over the loan\nterm apply only to interest owed, not to principal. At the end of the term, the full\nbalance must be paid off in a lump-sum, \"balloon\" payment. Since these loans\nhave no periodic principal payback, their monthly payments are smaller than\namortizing loans for the same amount at the same rate of interest.\nBuydown loan. A buydown loan entails a prepayment of interest on a loan. The\nprepayment effectively lowers the interest rate and the periodic payments for the\nborrower. Buydowns typically occur in a circumstance where a builder wants to\nmarket a new development to a buyer who cannot quite qualify for the necessary\nloan at market rates. By \"buying down\" a borrower's mortgage, a builder enables\nthe borrower to obtain the loan. The builder may then pass the costs of the\nbuydown through to the buyer in the form of a higher purchase price.\nSeller financing The seller may provide some or all of the financing for the buyer's purchase. Some\nof the most common methods of seller financing are purchase money mortgages,\nincluding the wraparound, and the contract for deed.\nPurchase money mortgage. With a purchase money mortgage, the borrower\ngives a mortgage and note to the seller to finance some or all of the purchase\nprice of the property. The seller in this case is said to \"take back\" a note, or to\nChapter 17: Real Estate Finance 275",

    "text": "\"carry paper,\" on the property. Purchase money mortgages may be either senior\nor junior liens.\nWraparound. In a wraparound loan arrangement, the seller receives a junior\nmortgage from the buyer, and uses the buyer's payments to make the payments on\nthe original first mortgage. A wraparound enables the buyer to obtain financing\nwith a minimum cash investment. It also potentially enables the seller to profit\nfrom any difference between a lower interest rate on the senior loan and a higher\nrate on the wraparound loan. A wraparound is possible only if the senior\nmortgagee allows it.\nContract for deed. Under a contract for deed arrangement, the seller retains title\nand the buyer receives possession and equitable title while making payments\nunder the terms of the contract. The seller conveys title when the contract has\nbeen fully performed.\nSpecial-purpose\nloans Home equity loan. The ostensible purpose of this type of loan is to obtain funds\nfor home improvement. Structurally, the home equity loan is a junior mortgage\nsecured by the homeowner's equity, equity in general being the portion of the\nproperty\u2019s value actually owned by the homeowner, expressed as the difference\nbetween the property\u2019s market value and all loan balances outstanding on the\nproperty.\nFor some lenders, the maximum home equity loan amount is based on the\ndifference between the property's appraised value and the maximum loan-to-\nvalue ratio the lender allows on the property, inclusive of all existing mortgage\nloans. Thus if a home is appraised at $500,000 and the lender's maximum LTV is\n80%, the lender will lend a total of $400,000. If the owner's existing mortgage\nbalance is $325,000, the owner would qualify for a $75,000 home equity loan.\nPackage loan. A package loan finances the purchase of real estate and personal\nproperty. For example, a package loan might finance a furnished condominium,\ncomplete with all fixtures and decor.\nConstruction loan. A construction loan finances construction of improvements.\nThis type of loan is paid out by the lender in installments linked to stages of the\nconstruction process. The loan is usually interest-only, and the borrower makes\nperiodic payments based on the amount disbursed so far. As short-term, high-risk\nfinancing, the interest rates are usually higher than those for long-term financing.\nThe borrower is expected to find permanent (\"take out\") financing elsewhere to\npay off the temporary loan when construction is complete.\nBridge loan. A bridge, or gap, loan is used to cover a gap in financing between\nshort-term construction financing and long-term permanent financing. For\ninstance, a developer may have difficulty finding a long-term lender to take out\nthe construction lender. However, as the construction loan is expensive and must\nbe paid off as soon as possible, the developer may find an interim lender who will\npay off the construction loan but not agree to a long-term loan.\nParticipation loan. In a participation loan, the lender participates in the income\nand/or equity of the property, in return for giving the borrower more favorable\nloan terms than would otherwise be justified. For instance, the borrower makes\n276 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

This\ntype of loan usually involves an income property.\nPermanent (take-out) loan. A permanent loan is a long-term loan that \"takes\nout\" a construction or short-term lender. The long-term lender pays off the\nbalance on the construction loan when the project is completed, leaving the\nborrower with a long-term loan under more favorable terms than the construction\nloan offered.\nReverse annuity. In a reverse annuity mortgage, a homeowner pledges the\nequity in the home as security for a loan which is paid out in regular monthly\namounts over the term of the loan. The homeowner, in effect, is able to convert\nthe equity to cash without losing ownership and possession.\nBlanket.
