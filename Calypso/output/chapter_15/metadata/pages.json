However, brokers and agents do need a basic understanding of\nhow our economy works, and particularly, how real estate as an economic\nproduct fits into the real estate marketplace.\nUnderstanding the fundamentals of real estate economics enables one to:\n\uf034 recognize the effect of current economic conditions in the real estate\nmarket on transactions, prices, and values\n\uf034 apply economic principles to estimates of future conditions in the\nreal estate market\n\uf034 apply economic principles to specific geographical areas and\nproperty types in order to assess economic conditions for a\nparticular property and site\nThese are abilities that will benefit the clients of any real estate professional.\nTHE MARKET SYSTEM\nSupply and demand\nPrice and value\nProductivity and costs\nMarket interaction\nMarket equilibrium\nSupply and demand The goal of an economic system is to produce and distribute a supply of goods\nand services to satisfy the demand of its constituents. Economic activity therefore\ncenters on the production, distribution and sale of goods and services to meet\nconsumer demand.\nSupply is the quantity of a product or service available for sale, lease, or trade\nat any given time.\nChapter 15 Market Economics 211",

    "text": "Demand is the quantity of a product or service that is desired for purchase,\nlease, or trade at any given time.\nThe interplay of supply and demand is what makes an economy work: consumers\ndemand goods and services; suppliers and sellers produce and distribute the\ngoods and services for a negotiated price.\nExhibit 15.1 Supply, Demand, Price\nPrice and value The price mechanism. In addition to supply and demand, the other critical\ncomponent of an economic system is the price mechanism, or simply, price. A\nprice is the amount of money or other asset that a buyer has agreed to pay and a\nseller has agreed to accept to complete the exchange of a good or service. It is a\nquantification of the value of an item traded.\nPrice in this context means the final trading price; it is not the preliminary asking\nprice of the seller nor the initial bidding price of the purchaser. Asking and\nbidding prices are pricing positions in a negotiation between the parties prior to\nthe exchange. The true price of an item or service is the final number the parties\nagree to.\nValue and value determinants. Price is not something of value in itself. It is\nonly a number that quantifies value. The economic issue underlying the interplay\nof supply and demand is, how do trading parties arrive at the value of a good or\nservice as indicated by the price?\n212 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Consider consumer demand for air conditioners. Why do air conditioners have\nvalue? How do they command the price they do?\nThe value of something is based on the answers to four questions:\n\uf034 How much do I desire it?\n\uf034 How useful is it?\n\uf034 How scarce is it?\n\uf034 Am I able to pay for it?\nDesire. One determinant of value is how dear the item is to the purchaser.\nReturning to the air conditioner example, the question becomes \"how much do I\ndesire to be cool, dry, and comfortable?\" To a person who lives in the tropics, it\nis safe to say that air conditioning is more valuable than a heating system. It is\nalso safe to say the opposite is true for residents of northern Alaska.\nUtility. The second determinant of value is the product's ability to do the job. Can\nthe air conditioner satisfy my need to stay cool? How cool does it make my\nhouse? Does it even work properly? Of course, I won't pay as much if it is old or\nineffectual.\nScarcity. The third critical element of value is a product's availability in relation\nto demand. The air conditioner is quite valuable if there are only five units in the\nentire city and everyone is hot. On the other hand, the value of an air conditioner\ngoes down if there are ten thousand units for sale in a 500-person market.\nPurchasing power. A fourth component of value is the consumer's ability to pay\nfor the item. If one cannot afford to buy the air conditioner, the value of the air\nconditioner is diminished, since it is financially out of reach. If all air\nconditioners are too expensive, consumers are forced to consider alternatives\nsuch as ceiling fans.\nIn the marketplace, the relative presence or absence of the four elements of value\nis constantly changing due to innumerable factors. Since price is a reflection of\nthe total of all value factors at any time, changes in the underlying factors of\nvalue trigger changes in price.\nProductivity\nand costs To produce a good or service, a supplier incurs costs, or those expenses necessary\nto generate and deliver the item to the market. The essential production costs are\nthe costs of capital, materials, and supplies; labor; management; and overhead.\nCosts play an important role in the dynamics of supply, demand, and value. Since\na producer has limited resources, it is imperative to maximize the efficiency of\nthe production process and minimize its costs. Moreover, since consumers will\npay the lowest possible price for comparable goods and services, the producer\nmust be price-competitive to stay in business. A competitor who can produce an\nitem of similar quality for less will eventually force higher-priced items out of the\nmarket.\nCost and price. Consider a producer who is efficient and produces the product or\nservice in demand at the lowest possible cost. Adding to the cost a required profit\nmargin, the producer establishes a minimum price for the item. In this scenario,\nChapter 15 Market Economics 213",

    "text": "cost essentially equals price. To the efficient producer, costs and sufficient profit\nare paramount, since a lower price puts the producer out of business. At that\npoint, the elements of value-- desire, utility, scarcity, and purchasing power-- do\nnot matter: if the consumer wants the item at all, he or she must cover the\nproducer's costs and profit.\nIn summary, supply, demand, and price interact continuously in a market.\nUnderlying and influencing these forces are the dynamics of value and the costs\nof producing goods and services.\nMarket interaction What is a market? A market is a place where supply and demand encounter one\nanother: suppliers sell or trade their goods and services to demanders, who are\nconsumers and buyers. It is a transaction arena where the price mechanism is\nconstantly defining and quantifying the value produced by the relative elements\nof supply and demand.\nSupply, demand and price interrelationships. In a market economy, the\nprimary interactions between supply, demand and price are:\n\uf034 if supply increases relative to demand, price decreases\n\uf034 if supply decreases relative to demand, price increases\n\uf034 if demand increases relative to supply, price increases\n\uf034 if demand decreases relative to supply, price decreases\nThese relationships reflect simple common sense: if a valued product becomes\nincreasingly scarce, its value and price go up as consumers compete for the limited\nsupply. If there is an overabundance of a product, the price falls, as demand is\nlargely met. On the other side, if demand for a product or service increases in\nrelation to supply, prices will go up as consumers compete for the popular item.\nIf demand diminishes, the price drops with it.\nThe inverse of these principles also applies. By tracking a price trend, one can\ndraw conclusions about supply and demand trends:\n\uf034 if price decreases, demand is declining in relation to supply\n\uf034 if price increases, demand is increasing in relation to supply\nTo assess price movements, the supply and demand of a product or service must\nalways be considered together. It is always possible for demand and supply to\nrise and fall together at the same rate, with no detectable price change resulting.\nFor example, if demand for bicycles jumps a million units, and manufacturers\neasily produce the necessary new supply, there may be no increase in price. The\nprice may even go down as manufacturers obtain better prices on the larger\nquantities of raw materials they now use.\nMarket equilibrium Another significant principle of supply/demand/price interaction is market\nequilibrium:\n\uf034 a market tends toward a state of equilibrium in which supply\nequals demand, and price, cost, and value are identical\n214 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "According to this principle, market demand moves to meet supply, and supply\nmoves to meet demand. If there is an extreme shortage of an item for which there\nis normally a strong demand, suppliers will rush to increase production to close\nthe gap. If inventories of an item are very high, suppliers will stop production\nuntil the oversupply has been depleted.\nSimilarly, if the price of an item far exceeds its cost, new suppliers will enter the\nmarket with lower prices. If the price of an item is far less than its perceived\nvalue, either consumers will bid up the price or the perceived value will decline.\nFor example, a new convenience store opens on the edge of a rapidly growing\ntown. The owners know demand will increase, so they anticipate the demand\nwith their increment of supply. Initially, the store creates excess supply, so\nbusiness is slow. However, as people move in, demand increases, and the store\nbegins to make substantial profits. After some time, other retailers hear that the\nstore is profitable: demand now significantly exceeds supply, and the operator's\ncosts are out of line with values and prices. A second retailer opens a store to\nequalize the imbalance. The new competitor, an addition of supply, now forces\nprices, costs, and profits into closer proximity.\nThe equilibrium time lag. In theory, markets strive for equilibrium, but in\nreality there is always a time lag between a recognized imbalance and the\ncompletion of the market adjustment. Since the underlying determinants of\nsupply and demand (scarcity, desire, utility, purchasing power and costs) are\nconstantly changing, a market is usually in some condition of imbalance.\nREAL ESTATE MARKET DYNAMICS\nEconomic characteristics of real estate\nReal estate supply and demand\nMarket influences on supply and demand\nAs an economic commodity, real estate is bought, sold, traded, and leased as a\nproduct within a real estate market.\nEconomic\ncharacteristics\nof real estate Real estate, like other products and services, is:\n\uf034 subject to the laws of supply and demand\n\uf034 governed in the market by the price mechanism\n\uf034 influenced by the producer's costs to bring the product to market\n\uf034 influenced by the determinants of value: utility, scarcity, desire,\nand purchasing power\nDistinguishing features.

Likewise, no two parcels of real estate can have exactly\nthe same value, except by coincidence.\n\uf034 demand must come to the supply\nSince real property cannot be moved, real property investors and\nusers must come to the supply. This creates risk, because if\ndemand drops, the supply cannot be transported to a higher\ndemand market.\n\uf034 illiquid\nReal estate is a relatively illiquid economic product, meaning it\ncannot always be readily sold for cash. Since it is a large, long-\nterm investment that has no exact duplicate, buyers must go\nthrough a complex process to evaluate and purchase the right\nparcel of real estate.\n\uf034 slow to respond to changes\nReal estate is relatively slow to respond to market imbalances.\nBecause new construction is a large-scale, time-consuming\nprocess, the market is slow to respond to increases in demand. The\nmarket is similarly slow to respond to sharp declines in demand,\nsince the product cannot be moved and sold elsewhere. Instead,\nowners must wait out slow periods and simply hope for the best.\n\uf034 decentralized, local market\nA real property cannot be shipped to a large, central real estate\nmarketplace. Real estate markets are thus local in nature and\nhighly susceptible to swings in the local economy.\nReal estate supply\nand demand Supply. In real estate, supply is the amount of property available for sale or lease\nat any given time. Note that supply is generally not the number of properties\navailable, except in the case of residential real estate. The units of supply used to\nquantify the amount of property available differ for different categories of\nproperty. These supply units, by property type, are:\n\uf034 residential: dwelling units\n\uf034 commercial and industrial: square feet\n\uf034 agricultural: acreage\n216 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Real estate demand is the amount of property buyers and tenants wish\nto acquire by purchase, lease or trade at any given time. Units of demand, by\nproperty classification, are:\n\uf034 residential: households\n\uf034 commercial and industrial: square feet\n\uf034 agricultural: acreage\nThe unit of residential demand is the household, which is an individual or family\nwho would occupy a dwelling unit. Residential demand can be further broken\ndown into demand to lease versus buy, and demand for single family homes\nversus apartments.\nResidential demand can be very difficult to quantify. One measure is the number\nof buyers employing agents to locate property. Another measure is the net\npopulation change in an area, plus families that attempted to move in but could\nnot.\nThe unit of commercial (retail and office) and industrial real estate demand is the\nsquare foot, further broken down into demand for leased space versus purchased\nspace. In most instances, the area demanded refers to the improved area rather\nthan the total lot area.\nDemand for office and industrial real estate is calculated by identifying\nemployment growth or shrinkage in a market, then multiplying the employment\nchange times the average area of floor space a typical employee uses. For\nexample, consider an office property market where employment in the\ncommunity increases by 500 employees. If each employee uses an average of 120\nsquare feet, the increased demand for space is 60,000 square feet.\nFactors affecting demand. The demand for particular types of real estate relates\nto the specific concerns of users. These concerns revolve around the components\nof value: desire, utility, scarcity, and purchasing power.\nResidential users are concerned with:\n\uf034 quality of life\n\uf034 neighborhood quality\n\uf034 convenience and access to services and other facilities\n\uf034 dwelling amenities in relation to household size, lifestyle, and\ncosts\nChapter 15 Market Economics 217",

    "text": "Base employment is the number of persons employed in the businesses that\nrepresent the economic foundation of the area. For example, the auto industry has\ntraditionally been the primary base employer of the Detroit metropolitan area.\nBase industries lead to the rise of supporting and secondary industries in the\nmarket. If the auto industry is the base, auto parts manufacturers and assembly\nindustries will develop to support the auto manufacturing plants. In addition,\nservice businesses emerge to support the many needs of the local population\nengaged in primary and secondary employment.\nThus, base employment feeds total employment. Total employment in a market\nincludes base, secondary, and support industries. Total employment creates a\ndemand for a labor force. From total employment derives demand for industrial\nand office space on the one hand; on the other hand, as employment grows, so\ngrows the population, leading to the demand for housing and for retail support. In\naddition to creating demand for real estate, employment creates the purchasing\npower necessary for households to acquire dwellings and retail products.\nWithout employment, a real estate market evaporates, as there is no demand for\ncommercial or industrial facilities, nor is there demand for retail services or\nhousing. The best example of this phenomenon is a gold rush boom town: as\nsoon as the gold runs out, there is no more mining. Without mining employment,\neveryone moves away and the town becomes a ghost town.\nSupply and demand interaction.

Vacancy is the\namount of total real estate inventory of a certain type that is unoccupied at a\ngiven time. Absorption is the amount of available property that becomes\noccupied over a period of time.\nTaking the point of undersupply, or high demand, as a starting point in the cycle,\nvacancy is low and prices are high. This situation stimulates suppliers to\nconstruct additional housing or commercial space. New construction, by adding\nsupply, causes vacancy to rise and prices to fall until supply-demand equilibrium\nresults. As more new space is added, supply begins to outstrip demand, vacancy\ncontinues to rise, and prices continue to fall. At the bottom of the cycle, prices\nand vacancy are at unacceptable levels, and construction ceases. The market\n\"dies\" until excess supply can be absorbed. The absorption process continues\nthrough the equilibrium point until price and vacancy conditions are sufficiently\nattractive to encourage renewed construction. Then the cycle repeats.\nMarket influences\nOn supply and\ndemand Numerous factors in a market influence the real estate cycle to speed up or slow\ndown. These influences can be local or national, and from the public or private\neconomic sector.\nLocal market influences.

Regional and national economic forces influence the local real\nestate market in the form of:\n\uf034 changes in money supply\n\uf034 inflation\n\uf034 national economic cycles\nIn recent years international economic trends have increasingly influenced local\nreal estate markets, particularly in border states, large metropolitan areas, and in\nmarkets where the economic base is tied to foreign trade. In these instances,\ncurrency fluctuations have significant impact on the local economy.\nGovernmental influences.
