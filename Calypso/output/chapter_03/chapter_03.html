            <p class="paragraph">
                An undivided interest is an owner's interest in a property in which two or more parties share ownership. The terms "undivided" and "indivisible" signify that the owner's interest is in a fractional part of the entire estate, not in a physical portion of the real property itself. If two co-owners have an undivided equal interest, one owner may not lay claim to the northern half of the property for his or her exclusive use.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Interests are principally distinguished by whether they include possession. If the interest-holder enjoys the right of possession, the party is considered to have an <strong>estate in land</strong>, or familiarly an estate. If a private interest-holder does not have the right to possess, the interest is an <strong>encumbrance</strong>. If the interest-holder is not private, such as a government entity, and does not have the right to possess, the interest is some form of <strong>public interest</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                An encumbrance enables a non-owning party to restrict the owner's bundle of rights. Tax liens, mortgages, easements, and encroachments are examples.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Public entities may own or lease real estate, in which case they enjoy an estate in land. However, government entities also have non-possessory interests in real estate which act to control land use for the public good within the entity's jurisdiction. The prime example of public interest is <strong>police power</strong>, or the right of the local or county government to zone. Another example of public interest is the right to acquire ownership through the power of <strong>eminent domain</strong>.

            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Estates in land</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                An estate in land is an interest that includes the right of possession. Depending on the length of time one may enjoy the right to possess the estate, the relationships of the parties owning the estate, and specific interests held in the estate, an estate is a freehold or a leasehold estate.

                In a freehold estate, the duration of the owner's rights cannot be determined: the rights may endure for a lifetime, for less than a lifetime, or for generations beyond the owner's lifetime.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                A <strong>leasehold estate</strong> is distinguished by its specific duration, as represented by the lease term.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Ownership of a freehold estate is commonly equated with ownership of the property, whereas ownership of a leasehold estate is not so considered because the leaseholder's rights are temporary.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Both leasehold and freehold estates are referred to as <strong>tenancies</strong>. The owner of the freehold estate is the <strong>freehold tenant</strong>, and the renter, or lessee, is the <strong>leasehold tenant</strong>.

                The fee simple freehold estate is the highest form of ownership interest one can acquire in real estate. It includes the complete bundle of rights, and the tenancy is unlimited, with certain exceptions indicated below. The fee simple interest is also called the "fee interest," or simply, the "fee." The owner of the fee simple interest is called the fee tenant.

                Fee Simple Absolute. The fee simple absolute estate is a perpetual estate that is not conditioned by stipulated or restricted uses. It may also be freely passed on to heirs. For these reasons, the fee simple absolute estate is the most desirable estate that can be obtained in residential real estate. It is also the most common.

                A homestead is a legal life estate that provides protection for the family home.

The elective share is a legal right of a surviving spouse to inherit a specified percentage of a deceased spouse's estate, typically between one-fourth and one-half, even if the will denies the spouse property.

            <p class="paragraph">
                A leasehold estate is the interest of a renter, lessee, or tenant in leased property. A leasehold estate is characterized by a specified duration: the lease term. A lease is a contract that establishes the terms and conditions under which one party will rent property from another.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Periodic tenancy -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Periodic tenancy</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                A periodic tenancy is a leasehold with a fixed period that automatically renews unless proper notice is given by either party. The estate may be month-to-month, year-to-year, or week-to-week.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                At the end of the six months, the tenant pays, and the landlord accepts monthly rent payment. The acceptance of the rent automatically renews the leasehold for another six months.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The most common form of periodic tenancy is the month-to-month tenancy. Monthly tenancies may exist without any written agreement.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Either party may terminate a periodic tenancy by giving proper notice to the other party. Proper notice is defined by state law.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Estate at will -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Estate at will</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The estate at will, also called a tenancy at will, has no definite expiration date and hence no "renewal" cycle. The landlord and tenant agree that the will have no specified termination date, provided rent is paid and lease conditions are met.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                For example, a son leases a house to his father and mother "for as long as they want to move.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The estate at will is terminated by proper notice, or by the death of either party.
            </p>
