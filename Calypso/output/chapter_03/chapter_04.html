            <p class="paragraph">
                There are numerous ways of holding ownership of a freehold estate, according to how many parties (tenants) share the ownership, and how they share it. The primary distinction is between ownership by a single party and ownership by multiple parties. Various trust structures enable owners to employ a trustee to hold and manage an estate. Condominiums, cooperatives, and time-shares are hybrids that combine several forms of ownership.

            <!-- Subsection: Joint tenancy -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Joint tenancy</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership in which owners take title to the entire property as one unit, with each owner possessing an undivided right of possession of the whole. Upon the death of a joint tenant, the deceased tenant's share automatically passes to the surviving co-owners. The survivors retain equal rights of possession in the property.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The essential characteristics of the joint tenancy are:
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Unity of ownership -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Unity of ownership</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Whereas tenants in common hold separate title to their individual interests, joint tenants together hold a single title to the property.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Equal ownership -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Equal ownership</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Joint tenants own equal shares in the property, without exception. If there are four co-tenants, each owns 25% of the property. If there are ten co-tenants, each owns 10%.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Transfer of interest -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Transfer of interest</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                A joint tenant may transfer his or her interest in the property to an outside party, but only as a tenancy in common. Any new owner who acquires the interest co-owns the property as a tenant in common with the remaining joint tenants. The remaining joint tenants continue to own and share equally in the property, less the new cotenant's share.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Survivorship -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Survivorship</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                In most states, joint tenants enjoy rights of survivorship. When a joint tenant dies, that tenant's share passes to the surviving joint tenants.
            </p>
        

            <p class="paragraph">
                The exhibit shows three parties, A, B and C, who acquired a property as joint tenants. By definition, each owns a one-third share. If C sells his interest to D, A and B automatically become joint tenants of two-thirds of the property, and D becomes a tenant in common with A and B. D's interest will pass to her heirs, not to A and B.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                If C dies, A and B receive equal shares of C's estate, making their shares equal 50%. If B then dies, A acquires the whole estate and becomes the sole owner. This event terminates the joint tenancy estate, and it becomes property in severalty.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Creation of joint tenancy -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Creation of joint tenancy</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                To create a joint tenancy, all owners must acquire the property at the same time, use the same deed, acquire equal shares, and share in equal rights of possession. These are referred to as the "four unities"
