            <p class="paragraph">
                Interests are principally distinguished by whether they include possession. If the interest-holder enjoys the right of possession, the party is considered to have an <strong>estate in land</strong>, or familiarly an estate. If a private interest-holder does not have the right to possess, the interest is an <strong>encumbrance</strong>. If the interest-holder is not private, such as a government entity, and does not have the right to possess, the interest is some form of <strong>public interest</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                An encumbrance enables a non-owning party to restrict the owner's bundle of rights. Tax liens, mortgages, easements, and encroachments are examples.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Public entities may own or lease real estate, in which case they enjoy an estate in land. However, government entities also have non-possessory interests in real estate which act to control land use for the public good within the entity's jurisdiction. The prime example of public interest is <strong>police power</strong>, or the right of the local or county government to zone. Another example of public interest is the right to acquire ownership through the power of <strong>eminent domain</strong>.

            <p class="paragraph">
                An estate in land is an interest that includes the right of possession. Depending on the length of time one may enjoy the right to possess the estate, the relationships of the parties owning the estate, and specific interests held in the estate, an estate is a freehold or a leasehold estate.
