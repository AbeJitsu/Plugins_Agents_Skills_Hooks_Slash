│  Interests are principally distinguished by whether they include possession.│
│  If the interest-holder enjoys the right of possession, the party is       │
│  considered to have an estate in land, or familiarly an estate. If a       │
│  private interest-holder does not have the right to possess, the interest  │
│  is an encumbrance. If the interest-holder is not private, such as a       │
│  government entity, and does not have the right to possess, the interest   │
│  is some form of public interest.                                           │
│                                                                             │

│  An encumbrance enables a non-owning party to restrict the owner's bundle  │
│  of rights. Tax liens, mortgages, easements, and encroachments are         │
│  examples.                                                                   │

│  Public entities may own or lease real estate, in which case they enjoy an │
│  estate in land. However, government entities also have non-possessory     │
│  interests in real estate which act to control land use for the public good│
│  within the entity's jurisdiction. The prime example of public interest is  │
│  police power, or the right of the local or county government to zone.     │
│  Another example of public interest is the right to acquire ownership      │
│  through the power of eminent domain.                                       │
│                                                                             │

│  An estate in land is an interest that includes the right of possession.   │
│  Depending on the length of time one may enjoy the right to possess the    │
│  estate, the relationships of the parties owning the estate, and specific  │
│  interests held in the estate, an estate is a freehold or a leasehold      │
│  estate.                                                                     │
