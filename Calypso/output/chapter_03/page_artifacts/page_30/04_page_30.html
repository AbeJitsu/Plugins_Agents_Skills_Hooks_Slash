                In a freehold estate, the duration of the owner's rights cannot be determined: the rights may endure for a lifetime, for less than a lifetime, or for generations beyond the owner's lifetime.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                A <strong>leasehold estate</strong> is distinguished by its specific duration, as represented by the lease term.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Ownership of a freehold estate is commonly equated with ownership of the property, whereas ownership of a leasehold estate is not so considered because the leaseholder's rights are temporary.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Both leasehold and freehold estates are referred to as <strong>tenancies</strong>. The owner of the freehold estate is the <strong>freehold tenant</strong>, and the renter, or lessee, is the <strong>leasehold tenant</strong>.

                Freehold estates differ primarily according to the duration of the estate and what happens to the estate when the owner dies. A freehold estate of potentially unlimited duration is a <strong>fee simple estate</strong>: an estate limited to the life of the owner is a <strong>life estate</strong>.
