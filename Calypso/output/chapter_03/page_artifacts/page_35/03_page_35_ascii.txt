│  A homestead is a legal life estate that provides protection for the family│
│  home. It protects a portion of a home's equity from judgment creditors     │
│  during bankruptcy proceedings and other economic hardships. A homestead    │
│  estate grants the surviving spouse a legal life estate in the marital      │
│  residence.                                                                 │

│  Dower and curtesy are legal rights that provide protection for the        │
│  surviving spouse. The right of dower is claimed by a widow and is usually  │
│  a one-third interest in the deceased husband's real property estate. The   │
│  right of curtesy provides the widower with a legal interest in the        │
│  deceased wife's property.                                                  │

│  Curtesy is generally equal to the rights of dower, or it may be for a     │
│  life estate in the entire property. Curtesy can only apply when children  │
│  were born of the marriage.                                                 │

│  An elective share, also known as the widow's dower or statutory share, is │
│  a provision of a property owner's will granting certain property rights to │
│  a surviving spouse. The elective share is a legal right of a surviving     │
│  spouse to inherit a specified percentage of a deceased spouse's estate,    │
│  typically between one-fourth and one-half, even if the will denies the     │
│  spouse property.                                                           │

│  A leasehold estate is the interest of a renter, lessee, or tenant in      │
│  leased property. A leasehold estate is characterized by a specified        │
│  duration: the lease term. A lease is a contract that establishes the terms │
│  and conditions under which one party will rent property from another.      │
│                                                                             │
