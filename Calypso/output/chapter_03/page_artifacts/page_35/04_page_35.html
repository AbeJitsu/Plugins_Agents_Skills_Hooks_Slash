                A legal life estate is created by law rather than by grant or agreement. Legal life estates include homesteads, dowry rights, and elective share interests.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Homestead -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Homestead</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                A homestead is a legal life estate that provides protection for the family home. It protects a portion of a home's equity from judgment creditors during bankruptcy proceedings and other economic hardships. A homestead estate grants the surviving spouse a legal life estate in the marital residence.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Dower and Curtesy -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Dower and Curtesy</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Dower and curtesy are legal rights that provide protection for the surviving spouse. The right of dower is claimed by a widow and is usually a one-third interest in the deceased husband's real property estate. The right of curtesy provides the widower with a legal interest in the deceased wife's property.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Curtesy is generally equal to the rights of dower, or it may be for a life estate in the entire property. Curtesy can only apply when children were born of the marriage.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Elective Share -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Elective Share</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                An elective share, also known as the widow's dower or statutory share, is a provision of a property owner's will granting certain property rights to a surviving spouse. The elective share is a legal right of a surviving spouse to inherit a specified percentage of a deceased spouse's estate, typically between one-fourth and one-half, even if the will denies the spouse property.

            <h2 class="section-heading">LEASEHOLD ESTATES</h2>

            <p class="paragraph">
                A leasehold estate is the interest of a renter, lessee, or tenant in leased property. A leasehold estate is characterized by a specified duration: the lease term. A lease is a contract that establishes the terms and conditions under which one party will rent property from another.
