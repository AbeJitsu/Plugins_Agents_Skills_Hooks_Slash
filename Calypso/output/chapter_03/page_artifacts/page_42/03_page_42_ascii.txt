│  The exhibit shows three parties, A, B and C, who acquired a property as   │
│  joint tenants. By definition, each owns a one-third share. If C sells his │
│  interest to D, A and B automatically become joint tenants of two-thirds of│
│  the property, and D becomes a tenant in common with A and B. D's interest │
│  will pass to her heirs, not to A and B.                                    │
│                                                                             │

│  If C dies, A and B receive equal shares of C's estate, making their shares│
│  equal 50%. If B then dies, A acquires the whole estate and becomes the    │
│  sole owner. This event terminates the joint tenancy estate, and it becomes│
│  property in severalty.                                                     │

│  To create a joint tenancy, all owners must acquire the property at the    │
