                The exhibit shows three parties, A, B and C, who acquired a property as joint tenants. By definition, each owns a one-third share. If C sells his interest to D, A and B automatically become joint tenants of two-thirds of the property, and D becomes a tenant in common with A and B. D's interest will pass to her heirs, not to A and B.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                If C dies, A and B receive equal shares of C's estate, making their shares equal 50%. If B then dies, A acquires the whole estate and becomes the sole owner. This event terminates the joint tenancy estate, and it becomes property in severalty.
