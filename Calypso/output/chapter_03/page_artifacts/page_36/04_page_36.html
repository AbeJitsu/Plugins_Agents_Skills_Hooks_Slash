            <p class="paragraph">
                A periodic tenancy is a leasehold with a fixed period that automatically renews unless proper notice is given by either party. The estate may be month-to-month, year-to-year, or week-to-week.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                At the end of the six months, the tenant pays, and the landlord accepts monthly rent payment. The acceptance of the rent automatically renews the leasehold for another six months.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The most common form of periodic tenancy is the month-to-month tenancy. Monthly tenancies may exist without any written agreement.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Either party may terminate a periodic tenancy by giving proper notice to the other party. Proper notice is defined by state law.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Estate at will -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Estate at will</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The estate at will, also called a tenancy at will, has no definite expiration date and hence no "renewal" cycle. The landlord and tenant agree that the will have no specified termination date, provided rent is paid and lease conditions are met.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                For example, a son leases a house to his father and mother "for as long as they want to move.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The estate at will is terminated by proper notice, or by the death of either party.
