            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Joint tenancy</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership in which owners take title to the entire property as one unit, with each owner possessing an undivided right of possession of the whole. Upon the death of a joint tenant, the deceased tenant's share automatically passes to the surviving co-owners. The survivors retain equal rights of possession in the property.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The essential characteristics of the joint tenancy are:
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Unity of ownership -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Unity of ownership</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Whereas tenants in common hold separate title to their individual interests, joint tenants together hold a single title to the property.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Equal ownership -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Equal ownership</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Joint tenants own equal shares in the property, without exception. If there are four co-tenants, each owns 25% of the property. If there are ten co-tenants, each owns 10%.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Transfer of interest -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Transfer of interest</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                A joint tenant may transfer his or her interest in the property to an outside party, but only as a tenancy in common. Any new owner who acquires the interest co-owns the property as a tenant in common with the remaining joint tenants. The remaining joint tenants continue to own and share equally in the property, less the new cotenant's share.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Survivorship -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Survivorship</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                In most states, joint tenants enjoy rights of survivorship. When a joint tenant dies, that tenant's share passes to the surviving joint tenants.
