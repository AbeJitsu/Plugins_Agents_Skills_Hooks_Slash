│  Joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership in which owners take title to the │
│  entire property as one unit, with each owner possessing an undivided      │
│  right of possession of the whole. Upon the death of a joint tenant, the   │
│  deceased tenant's share automatically passes to the surviving co-owners.   │
│  The survivors retain equal rights of possession in the property.           │
│                                                                             │

│  Whereas tenants in common hold separate title to their individual         │
│  interests, joint tenants together hold a single title to the property.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Joint tenants own equal shares in the property, without exception. If     │
│  there are four co-tenants, each owns 25% of the property. If there are    │
│  ten co-tenants, each owns 10%.                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  A joint tenant may transfer his or her interest in the property to an     │
│  outside party, but only as a tenancy in common. Any new owner who         │
│  acquires the interest co-owns the property as a tenant in common with the │
│  remaining joint tenants. The remaining joint tenants continue to own and  │
│  share equally in the property, less the new cotenant's share.             │
│                                                                             │

│  In most states, joint tenants enjoy rights of survivorship. When a joint  │
│  tenant dies, that tenant's share passes to the surviving joint tenants.   │
