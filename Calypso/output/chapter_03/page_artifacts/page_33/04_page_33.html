            <p class="paragraph">
                A conventional life estate is created by grant from a fee simple property owner to the grantee, the life tenant. Following the termination of the estate, rights pass to a remainderman or revert to the previous owner.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                During the life estate period, the owner enjoys all ownership rights, provided he or she does not infringe on the rights of the remainder or reversion interest holders, such as by damaging the property or jeopardizing its value. Should such actions occur, holders of the future interest may take legal action against the property owners.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The two types of conventional life estate are the ordinary and the pur autre vie life estate.
