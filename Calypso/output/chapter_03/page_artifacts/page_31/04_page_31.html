            <p class="paragraph">
                The fee simple freehold estate is the highest form of ownership interest one can acquire in real estate. It includes the complete bundle of rights, and the tenancy is unlimited, with certain exceptions indicated below. The fee simple interest is also called the "fee interest," or simply, the "fee." The owner of the fee simple interest is called the fee tenant.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Fee simple estates, like all estates, remain subject to government restrictions and private interests.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                There are two forms of fee simple estate: absolute and defeasible.

                Fee Simple Absolute. The fee simple absolute estate is a perpetual estate that is not conditioned by stipulated or restricted uses. It may also be freely passed on to heirs. For these reasons, the fee simple absolute estate is the most desirable estate that can be obtained in residential real estate. It is also the most common.
