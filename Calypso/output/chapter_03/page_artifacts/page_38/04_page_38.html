                There are numerous ways of holding ownership of a freehold estate, according to how many parties (tenants) share the ownership, and how they share it. The primary distinction is between ownership by a single party and ownership by multiple parties. Various trust structures enable owners to employ a trustee to hold and manage an estate. Condominiums, cooperatives, and time-shares are hybrids that combine several forms of ownership.
