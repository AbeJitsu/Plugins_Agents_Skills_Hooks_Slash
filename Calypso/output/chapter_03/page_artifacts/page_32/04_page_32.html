            <!-- Subsection: Fee Simple Defeasible -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Fee Simple Defeasible</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The defeasible fee estate is perpetual, provided the usage conforms to stated conditions. Essential characteristics are:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li class="bullet-item">the property must be used for a certain purpose or under certain conditions</li>
                <li class="bullet-item">if the use changes or if prohibited conditions are present, the estate reverts to the previous grantor of the estate</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The two types of fee simple defeasible are determinable and condition subsequent.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Determinable -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Determinable</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The deed to the determinable estate states usage limitations. If the restrictions are violated, the estate automatically reverts to the grantor or heirs.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Condition subsequent -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Condition subsequent</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                If any condition is violated, the previous owner may repossess the property. However, reversion of the estate is not automatic: the grantor must re-take physical possession within a certain time frame.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Life estate -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Life estate</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                A life estate is a freehold estate that is limited in duration to the life of the owner or other named person. Upon the death of the owner or other named individual, the estate passes to the original owner or another named party. The holder of a life estate is called the life tenant.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The distinguishing characteristics of the life estate are:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li class="bullet-item">the owner enjoys full ownership rights during the estate period</li>
                <li class="bullet-item">holders of the future interest own either a reversionary or remainder interest</li>
                <li class="bullet-item">the estate may be created by agreement between private parties, or it may be created by law under prescribed circumstances</li>
            </ul>
