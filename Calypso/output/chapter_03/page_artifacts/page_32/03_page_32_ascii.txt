│  The deed to the determinable estate states usage limitations. If the      │
│  restrictions are violated, the estate automatically reverts to the        │

│  If any condition is violated, the previous owner may repossess the        │
│  property. However, reversion of the estate is not automatic: the grantor   │
│  must re-take physical possession within a certain time frame.              │

│  A life estate is a freehold estate that is limited in duration to the life│
│  of the owner or other named person. Upon the death of the owner or other  │
│  named individual, the estate passes to the original owner or another named │
│  party. The holder of a life estate is called the life tenant.             │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │
