                The distinguishing characteristics of the life estate are:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li class="bullet-item">the owner enjoys full ownership rights during the estate period</li>
                <li class="bullet-item">holders of the future interest own either a reversionary or remainder interest</li>
                <li class="bullet-item">the estate may be created by agreement between private parties, or it may be created by law under prescribed circumstances</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Remainder -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Remainder</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                If a life estate names a third party to receive title to the property upon termination of the life estate, the party enjoys a future interest called a remainder interest or a remainder estate. The holder of a remainder interest is called a remainderman.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Reversion -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading">Reversion</h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                If no remainder estate is established, the estate reverts to the original owner or the owner's heirs. In this situation, the original owner retains a reversionary interest or estate.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The two types of life estates are the conventional and the legal life estate.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Pur autre vie -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Pur autre vie</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                A pur autre vie life estate is a life estate measured in the life of someone other than the grantee. The estate terminates upon the death of the person whose life is measured, not the holder. If the holder dies before the measured-life person dies, the estate passes to the holder's heirs. Upon the death of the measured-life person, the estate terminates and passes as determined by the original instrument.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Legal life estate -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Legal life estate</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                A legal life estate is created by law rather than by grant or agreement. Legal life estates include homesteads, dowry rights, and elective share interests.
