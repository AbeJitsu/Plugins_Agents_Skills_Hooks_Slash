│  If a life estate names a third party to receive title to the property upon│
│  termination of the life estate, the party enjoys a future interest called a│
│  remainder interest or a remainder estate. The holder of a remainder        │
│  interest is called a remainderman.                                         │

│  If no remainder estate is established, the estate reverts to the original  │
│  owner or the owner's heirs. In this situation, the original owner retains a│
│  reversionary interest or estate.                                           │

│  A pur autre vie life estate is a life estate measured in the life of      │
│  someone other than the grantee. The estate terminates upon the death of   │
│  the person whose life is measured, not the holder. If the holder dies     │
│  before the measured-life person dies, the estate passes to the holder's   │
│  heirs. Upon the death of the measured-life person, the estate terminates  │
│  and passes as determined by the original instrument.                       │
│                                                                             │

│  A legal life estate is created by law rather than by grant or agreement.  │
│  Legal life estates include homesteads, dowry rights, and elective share   │
