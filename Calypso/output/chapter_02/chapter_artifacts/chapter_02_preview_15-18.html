                <p class="paragraph">
                    A simple definition of real estate is that it is air, water, land, and everything affixed to the land. Real estate in the United States may be owned privately by individuals and private entities or publicly by government entities. Private ownership rights in this country are not absolute. The government can impose taxes and restrictions on private ownership rights, and it can take private property away altogether. In addition, other private parties can exert their rights and interests on one's real property. A bank, for example, can take a property if the owner fails to pay a mortgage. A neighbor can claim the right to walk across one's property whether the owner likes it or not, provided he or she has done so for a certain number of years.
                </p>

                <!-- Definition Paragraph with Emphasis -->
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In attempting to define real estate, it is essential to understand <em>what rights and interests</em> parties have in a parcel of real estate. And to understand real estate rights and interests, one must first recognize the distinctions between:

            <p class="paragraph">
                Land, therefore, includes minerals beneath the earth's surface, water on or below the earth's surface, and the air above the surface. In addition, land includes all plants attached to the ground or in the ground, such as trees and grass. A <strong>parcel</strong>, or <strong>tract</strong>, of land is a portion of land delineated by boundaries.

            <!-- Subsection: Physical characteristics -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Physical characteristics.</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Land has three unique physical characteristics: <em>immobility, indestructibility, and heterogeneity</em>.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Land is immobile, since a parcel of land cannot be moved from one site to another. In other words, the geographical location of a tract of land is fixed and cannot be changed. One can transport portions of the land such as mined coal, dirt, or cut plants. However, as soon as such elements are detached from the land, they are no longer considered land.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Land is indestructible in the sense that one would have to remove a segment of the planet all the way to the core in order to destroy it. Even then, the portion extending upward to infinity would remain. For the same reason, land is considered to be permanent.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Land is non-homogeneous, since no two parcels of land are exactly the same. Admittedly, two adjacent parcels may be very similar and have the same economic value. However, they are inherently different because each parcel has a unique location.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Real estate (sidebar label style) -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Real estate</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The legal concept of real estate encompasses:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li class="bullet-item">land</li>
                <li class="bullet-item">all <em>man-made structures</em> that are "permanently" attached to the land</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Real estate therefore includes, in addition to land, such things as fences, streets, buildings, wells, sewers, sidewalks and piers. Such man-made structures attached to the land are called <strong>improvements</strong>. The phrase "permanently attached" refers primarily to one's intention in attaching the item. Obviously, very few if any manmade structures can be permanently attached to the land in the literal sense. But if a person constructs a house with the intention of creating a permanent dwelling, the house is considered real estate. By contrast, if a camper affixes a tent to the land with the intention of moving it to another camp in a week, the tent would not be considered real estate.

            <!-- Property Subsection -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Property</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                In common understanding, property is something that is owned by someone. A car is the property of Bill Brown if Bill Brown owns the car. If the item is not owned, it is not property. For example, if a car is abandoned and left to rust in the desert, the car is no longer property, since no one claims ownership. Similarly, the planet Jupiter is not property, since no one owns it.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                From a more technical standpoint, property is not only the item that is owned but also a <em>set of rights to the item enjoyed by the owner</em>. These rights are commonly known as the "bundle of rights."
            </p>

            <!-- Exhibit 2.2: The Bundle of Rights -->

                </div>
            </figure>

            <p class="paragraph">
                In owning property, one has the right to possess and use it as the law allows. The owner has the right to transfer ownership of the item (sell, rent, donate, assign, or bequeath). The owner may also encumber the item by mortgaging it as collateral for debt. Finally, the owner has the right to exclude others from use of the item.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                In the example of the car, when Bill Brown bought the car, the car became his property. Bill now has the right to use the car, sell it to someone else, rent it out, give it away, or mortgage it. Bill also has the right to prevent others from using his car.

                Property: he owned the car itself. At the same time, he also acquired the legal rights to transfer, use, encumber, exclude, and possess the car.
            </p>

            <!-- Classifications of property subsection -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Classifications of property.</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Our legal system recognizes two classifications of property: <em>real property</em> and <em>personal property</em>. <strong>Real property</strong> is ownership of real estate and the bundle of rights associated with owning the real estate. <strong>Personal property</strong> is ownership of anything which is not real estate, and the rights associated with owning the personal property item. Items of personal property are also called <strong>chattels</strong> or <strong>personalty</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Note: since all real estate in the United States is owned by some person, private organization, or government entity, all real estate in the country <em>is</em> real property. Given that fact, this text will follow the customary practice of using the two terms interchangeably and synonymously.
            </p>

            <!-- Tangible versus intangible property subsection -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Tangible versus intangible property.</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Real and personal property may be further categorized as <strong>tangible</strong> or <strong>intangible</strong> property. Tangible property is physical, visible, and material. Intangible property is abstract, having no physical existence in itself, other than as evidence of one's ownership interest.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                All real estate, by its physical nature, is tangible property. Personal property may be tangible or intangible. Boats, jewelry, coins, appliances, computers, and art work are examples of tangible personal property. Stocks, copyrights, bonds, trademarks, patents, franchises, and listing agreements are examples of intangible personal property.

            <!-- Real property rights subsection -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Real property rights</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Real property rights consist of the bundle of rights associated with owning a parcel of real estate. Foremost of these rights is the right of possession.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The <em>right to use</em> a property refers to the right to use it in certain ways, such as mining, cultivating, landscaping, razing, and building on the property. The right is subject to the limitations of local zoning and the legality of the use. One's right to use may not infringe on the rights of others to use and enjoy their property. For example, an owner may be restricted from constructing a large pond on her property if in fact the pond would pose flooding and drainage hazards to the next door neighbor.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The <em>right to transfer</em> interests in the property includes the right to sell, bequeath, lease, donate, or assign ownership interests. An owner may transfer certain individual rights to the property without transferring total ownership. Also, one may transfer ownership while retaining individual interests. For example, a property owner may lease the property to another person while retaining the title to the property itself.
