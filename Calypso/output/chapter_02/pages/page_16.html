            <p class="paragraph">plants attached to the ground or in the ground, such as trees and grass. A parcel,
or tract, of land is a portion of land delineated by boundaries.
Physical characteristics. Land has three unique physical
characteristics: immobility, indestructibility, and heterogeneity.
Land is immobile, since a parcel of land cannot be moved from one site to
another. In other words, the geographical location of a tract of land is fixed and
cannot be changed. One can transport portions of the land such as mined coal,
dirt, or cut plants. However, as soon as such elements are detached from the
land, they are no longer considered land.
Land is indestructible in the sense that one would have to remove a segment of
the planet all the way to the core in order to destroy it. Even then, the portion
extending upward to infinity would remain. For the same reason, land is
considered to be permanent.
Land is non-homogeneous, since no two parcels of land are exactly the same.
Admittedly, two adjacent parcels may be very similar and have the same
economic value. However, they are inherently different because each parcel has
a unique location.
Real estate The legal concept of real estate encompasses:
 land
 all man-made structures that are
"permanently" attached to the land
Real estate therefore includes, in addition to land, such things as fences, streets,
buildings, wells, sewers, sidewalks and piers. Such man-made structures attached
to the land are called improvements. The phrase "permanently attached" refers
primarily to one's intention in attaching the item. Obviously, very few if any
manmade structures can be permanently attached to the land in the literal sense.
But if a person constructs a house with the intention of creating a permanent
dwelling, the house is considered real estate. By contrast, if a camper affixes a
tent to the land with the intention of moving it to another camp in a week, the tent
would not be considered real estate.
