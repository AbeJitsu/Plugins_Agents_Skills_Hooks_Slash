            <p class="paragraph">Conversion The classification of an item of property as real or personal is not necessarily
fixed. The classification may be changed by the process of conversion.
Severance is the conversion of real property to personal property by detaching it
from the real estate, such as by cutting down a tree, detaching a door from a
shed, or removing an antenna from a roof. Affixing, or attachment, is the act of
converting personal property to real property by attaching it to the real estate,
such as by assembling a pile of bricks into a barbecue pit, or constructing a boat
dock from wood planks.
