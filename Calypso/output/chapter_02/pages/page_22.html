Conversion
In conveying real property, it is vitally important to recognize the distinctions
between personal property and the real property that is to be conveyed.
Confusion can arise because items of property may be either personal property
or real property, depending on circumstances.
The primary criterion for distinguishing real from personal property is whether
the item is permanently attached to the land or to structures attached to the land.
For example, a tree growing in one's yard is an item of real property. However,
when the owner cuts the tree down, it becomes personal property. Similarly, a
swimming pool pump on a shelf in the owner's garage is personal property. When
it is installed with the rest of the pool, it becomes real property.
While the "attachment" criterion is pivotal in distinguishing between real and
personal property, there are other tests to be applied. In addition, the
attachment rule is subject to exceptions.
Fixtures A personal property item that has been converted to real property by
attachment to real estate is called a fixture. Typical examples are chandeliers,
toilets, water pumps, septic tanks, and window shutters.
The owner of real property inherently owns all fixtures belonging to the real
property. When the owner sells the real property, the buyer acquires rights to all
fixtures. Fixtures not included in the sale must be itemized and excluded in the
sale contract.
Differentiation
criteria In the event that the attachment criterion is insufficient to determine whether
an article of property is real or personal, a court may apply one or more of
the following additional criteria.
Intention. One's original intention can override the test of movability in
determining whether an item is a fixture or not. If someone attached an item to
real property, yet intended to remove it after a period of time, the article may be
deemed personal property. If a person intended an article to be a fixture, even
though the item is easily removable, the article may be deemed a fixture.
For example, an apartment renter installs an alarm system, fully intending to
remove the system upon lease expiration. Here, the alarm system would be
considered personal property.
Adaptation. If an item is uniquely adapted to the property, or the property is
custom-designed to accommodate the item, it may be deemed real property
