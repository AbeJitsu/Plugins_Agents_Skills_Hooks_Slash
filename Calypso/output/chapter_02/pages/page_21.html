            <p class="paragraph">Littoral rights attach to the property. When the property is sold, the littoral
rights transfer with the property to the new owner.
Riparian rights. Riparian rights concern properties abutting moving water such
as streams and rivers. If a property abuts a stream or river, the owner's riparian
rights are determined by whether the water is navigable or not navigable. If the
property abuts a non-navigable stream, the owner enjoys unrestricted use of the
water and owns the land beneath the stream to the stream's midpoint. If the
waterway in question is navigable, the waterway is considered to be a public
easement. In such a case, the owner's property extends to the water's edge as
opposed to the midpoint of the waterway. The state owns the land beneath the
water.
Exhibit 2.5 Riparian Rights
One's riparian rights to use flowing water are subject to the conditions that:
 the usage is reasonable and does not infringe on the riparian
rights of other owners downstream
 the usage does not pollute the water
 the usage does not impede or alter the course of the water flow.
Like littoral rights, riparian rights attach to the property.
