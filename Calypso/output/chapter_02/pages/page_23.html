and a removable door screen are examples.
Functionality. If an item is vital to the operation of the building, it may be
deemed a fixture, even though perhaps easily removable. Window-unit air
conditioners and detachable solar panels are possible examples.
Relationship of parties. If a tenant installs a fixture in order to conduct business,
the fixture may be considered a trade fixture, which is the tenant's personal
property.
Sale or lease contract provisions. In a sale or lease transaction, the listing of an
item in the contract as a personal property item or a fixture overrides all other
considerations. Unless otherwise stated as exceptions, all fixtures are included in
the sale. For example, if a sale contract stipulates that the carpeting is not
included in the sale, it becomes a personal property item. If the carpeting is not
mentioned, it goes with the property, since it is attached to the floor of the
building.
Trade fixtures Trade fixtures, or chattel fixtures, are items of a tenant's personal property that
the tenant has temporarily affixed to a landlord's real property in order to conduct
business. Trade fixtures may be detached and removed before or upon surrender
of the leased premises. Should the tenant fail to remove a trade fixture, it may
become the property of the landlord through accession. Thereafter, the fixture is
considered real property.
Examples of trade fixtures include a grocer's food freezers, a merchant's clothes
racks, a tavern owner's bar, a dairy's milking machines, and a printer's printing
press.
Emblements Growing plants, including agricultural crops, may be either real property or
personal property. Plants and crops that grow naturally without requiring
anyone's labor or machinery are considered real property.
Plants and crops requiring human intervention and labor are called emblements.
Emblements, despite their attachment to land, are considered personal property.
If an emblement is owned by a tenant farmer, the tenant has the right to the
harvested crop whether the tenant's lease is active or expired. If the tenant grew
the crop, it is his or her personal property, and the landlord cannot take it.
Factory-built
housing Factory-built housing consists of dwelling units constructed off-site and
transported to and assembled on a building site. The category also includes
readily moveable housing of the type that can be relocated from place to place,
once known by the term mobile home. The National Manufactured Housing
Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1976 defined the types of factory-built
housing and retired the mobile home designation. Manufactured housing is
factory-built housing that conforms to HUD standards. Factory-built housing
may be considered real property or personal property, depending on whether it is
permanently affixed to the ground, and according to state law. Real estate
practitioners should understand the local laws before selling any kind of factory-
built housing.
