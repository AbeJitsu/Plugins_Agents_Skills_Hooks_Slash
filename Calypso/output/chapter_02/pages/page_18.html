Classifications of property. Our legal system recognizes two classifications of
property: real property and personal property. Real property is ownership of
real estate and the bundle of rights associated with owning the real estate.
Personal property is ownership of anything which is not real estate, and the
rights associated with owning the personal property item. Items of personal
property are also called chattels or personalty.
Note: since all real estate in the United States is owned by some person,
private organization, or government entity, all real estate in the country is real
property. Given that fact, this text will follow the customary practice of using
the two terms interchangeably and synonymously.
Tangible versus intangible property. Real and personal property may be further
categorized as tangible or intangible property. Tangible property is physical,
visible, and material. Intangible property is abstract, having no physical existence
in itself, other than as evidence of one's ownership interest.

All real estate, by its physical nature, is tangible property. Personal property
may be tangible or intangible. Boats, jewelry, coins, appliances, computers, and
art work are examples of tangible personal property. Stocks, copyrights, bonds,
trademarks, patents, franchises, and listing agreements are examples of
intangible personal property.
Real property rights Real property rights consist of the bundle of rights associated with owning a
parcel of real estate. Foremost of these rights is the right of possession.
The right to use a property refers to the right to use it in certain ways, such as
mining, cultivating, landscaping, razing, and building on the property. The right
is subject to the limitations of local zoning and the legality of the use. One's
right to use may not infringe on the rights of others to use and enjoy their
property. For example, an owner may be restricted from constructing a large
pond on her property if in fact the pond would pose flooding and drainage
hazards to the next door neighbor.
The right to transfer interests in the property includes the right to sell, bequeath,
lease, donate, or assign ownership interests. An owner may transfer certain
individual rights to the property without transferring total ownership. Also, one
may transfer ownership while retaining individual interests. For example, a
