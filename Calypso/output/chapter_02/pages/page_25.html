            <p class="paragraph">Regulation takes the form of federal and state laws and regulations; county and
local ordinances and codes; and court decisions in the judicial system.
Federal regulation In regulating real property rights, the federal government is primarily concerned
with broad standards of real property usage, natural disaster, land description, and
discrimination.
Federal agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration promote and
regulate home ownership. The Environmental Protection Agency establishes
protective usage restrictions and guidelines for dealing with hazardous materials
and other environmental concerns. Federal flood insurance legislation requires
certain homeowners to obtain flood insurance policies. Federal laws such as the
Federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibit discrimination in housing based on
race, religion, color, or national origin. Such laws as the Americans with
Disabilities Act prescribe design and accessibility standards.
The federal government does not levy real estate taxes.
State regulation State governments are the primary regulatory entities of the real estate business.
State governments establish real estate license laws and qualifications. In
addition, state governments have established real estate commissions to
administer license laws and oversee activities of licensees.
State governments also exert regional influence in the usage and
environmental control of real estate within the state. Relevant state laws
might include laws relating to flood zones, waste disposal, drainage control,
shore preservation, and pollution standards.
States also play a role in defining how real property may be owned,
transferred, encumbered, and inherited. For example, in some states a
mortgaged property becomes the legal property of the lender until the
mortgage loan is paid.
States have the power to levy real estate taxes but generally pass this power to
local government.
Local regulation County and local government regulation focuses on land use control, control of
improvements, and taxation. Land use regulations and ordinances control how
all property within the jurisdiction may be developed, improved, demolished,
and managed. County and local governments have the power to zone land, take
over land for the public good, issue building permits, and establish the rules for
all development projects.
County and local governments, along with school districts and other local
jurisdictions, have the power to levy real estate taxes.
Judicial
regulation The judicial system exerts an influence on real estate ownership and use
through decisions based on case law and common law, as distinguished from
statutory law. Case law consists of decisions based on judicial precedent.
Common law is the collective body of law deriving from custom and generally
accepted practice in society.
