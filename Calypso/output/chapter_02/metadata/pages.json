Real estate in the United States may be owned privately by\nindividuals and private entities or publicly by government entities. Private\nownership rights in this country are not absolute. The government can impose\ntaxes and restrictions on private ownership rights, and it can take private\nproperty away altogether. In addition, other private parties can exert their rights\nand interests on one's real property. A bank, for example, can take a property if\nthe owner fails to pay a mortgage. A neighbor can claim the right to walk across\none's property whether the owner likes it or not, provided he or she has done so\nfor a certain number of years.\nIn attempting to define real estate, it is essential to understand what rights and\ninterests parties have in a parcel of real estate. And to understand real estate\nrights and interests, one must first recognize the distinctions between:\n\uf034 land and real estate\n\uf034 real estate and property\n\uf034 real property and personal property\nLand The legal concept of land encompasses\n\uf034 the surface area of the earth\n\uf034 everything beneath the surface of the earth\nextending downward to its center\n\uf034 all natural things permanently attached to the earth\n\uf034 the air above the surface of the earth extending\noutward to infinity.\nLand, therefore, includes minerals beneath the earth's surface, water on or below\nthe earth's surface, and the air above the surface.

Land has three unique physical\ncharacteristics: immobility, indestructibility, and heterogeneity.\nLand is immobile, since a parcel of land cannot be moved from one site to\nanother. In other words, the geographical location of a tract of land is fixed and\ncannot be changed. One can transport portions of the land such as mined coal,\ndirt, or cut plants. However, as soon as such elements are detached from the\nland, they are no longer considered land.\nLand is indestructible in the sense that one would have to remove a segment of\nthe planet all the way to the core in order to destroy it. Even then, the portion\nextending upward to infinity would remain. For the same reason, land is\nconsidered to be permanent.\nLand is non-homogeneous, since no two parcels of land are exactly the same.\nAdmittedly, two adjacent parcels may be very similar and have the same\neconomic value. However, they are inherently different because each parcel has\na unique location.\nReal estate The legal concept of real estate encompasses:\n\uf034 land\n\uf034 all man-made structures that are\n\"permanently\" attached to the land\nReal estate therefore includes, in addition to land, such things as fences, streets,\nbuildings, wells, sewers, sidewalks and piers. Such man-made structures attached\nto the land are called improvements. The phrase \"permanently attached\" refers\nprimarily to one's intention in attaching the item. Obviously, very few if any\nmanmade structures can be permanently attached to the land in the literal sense.\nBut if a person constructs a house with the intention of creating a permanent\ndwelling, the house is considered real estate. By contrast, if a camper affixes a\ntent to the land with the intention of moving it to another camp in a week, the tent\nwould not be considered real estate.\nChapter 2: Rights in Real Estate 17",

    "text": "Exhibit 2.1 The Legal Concept of Land and Real Estate\nProperty In common understanding, property is something that is owned by someone. A\ncar is the property of Bill Brown if Bill Brown owns the car. If the item is not\nowned, it is not property. For example, if a car is abandoned and left to rust in the\ndesert, the car is no longer property, since no one claims ownership. Similarly,\nthe planet Jupiter is not property, since no one owns it.\nFrom a more technical standpoint, property is not only the item that is owned\nbut also a set of rights to the item enjoyed by the owner. These rights are\ncommonly known as the \"bundle of rights.\"\nExhibit 2.2 The Bundle of Rights\nIn owning property, one has the right to possess and use it as the law allows. The\nowner has the right to transfer ownership of the item (sell, rent, donate, assign, or\nbequeath). The owner may also encumber the item by mortgaging it as collateral\nfor debt. Finally, the owner has the right to exclude others from use of the item.\nIn the example of the car, when Bill Brown bought the car, the car became his\n18 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Our legal system recognizes two classifications of\nproperty: real property and personal property. Real property is ownership of\nreal estate and the bundle of rights associated with owning the real estate.\nPersonal property is ownership of anything which is not real estate, and the\nrights associated with owning the personal property item. Items of personal\nproperty are also called chattels or personalty.\nNote: since all real estate in the United States is owned by some person,\nprivate organization, or government entity, all real estate in the country is real\nproperty. Given that fact, this text will follow the customary practice of using\nthe two terms interchangeably and synonymously.\nTangible versus intangible property. Real and personal property may be further\ncategorized as tangible or intangible property. Tangible property is physical,\nvisible, and material. Intangible property is abstract, having no physical existence\nin itself, other than as evidence of one's ownership interest.\nExhibit 2.3 Tangible vs. Intangible Property\nTangible Intangible\nReal Property all types\nPersonal boat, car, jewelry stock certificate,\nProperty contract, patent\nAll real estate, by its physical nature, is tangible property. Personal property\nmay be tangible or intangible. Boats, jewelry, coins, appliances, computers, and\nart work are examples of tangible personal property. Stocks, copyrights, bonds,\ntrademarks, patents, franchises, and listing agreements are examples of\nintangible personal property.\nReal property rights Real property rights consist of the bundle of rights associated with owning a\nparcel of real estate. Foremost of these rights is the right of possession.\nThe right to use a property refers to the right to use it in certain ways, such as\nmining, cultivating, landscaping, razing, and building on the property. The right\nis subject to the limitations of local zoning and the legality of the use. One's\nright to use may not infringe on the rights of others to use and enjoy their\nproperty. For example, an owner may be restricted from constructing a large\npond on her property if in fact the pond would pose flooding and drainage\nhazards to the next door neighbor.\nThe right to transfer interests in the property includes the right to sell, bequeath,\nlease, donate, or assign ownership interests. An owner may transfer certain\nindividual rights to the property without transferring total ownership. Also, one\nmay transfer ownership while retaining individual interests. For example, a\nChapter 2: Rights in Real Estate 19",

    "text": "person may sell mineral rights without selling the right of possession. On the\nother hand, the owner may convey all rights to the property except the mineral\nrights.\nWhile all rights are transferrable, the owner can only transfer what the owner in\nfact possesses. A property seller, for example, cannot sell water rights if there\nare no water rights attached to the property.\nThe right to encumber the property essentially means the right to mortgage the\nproperty as collateral for debt. There may be restrictions to this right, such as a\nspouse's right to limit the degree to which a homestead may be mortgaged.\nThe right to exclude gives the property owner the legal right to keep others off\nthe property and to prosecute trespassers.\nThe bundle of real property rights also applies separately to the individual\ncomponents of real estate: the air, the surface, and the subsurface. An owner can,\nfor example, transfer subsurface rights without transferring air rights. Similarly,\nan owner can rent air space without encumbering surface or subsurface rights.\nThis might occur in a city where adjoining building owners want to construct a\nwalkway over a third owner's lot. Such owners would have to acquire the air\nrights for the walkway. If the city wants to construct a subway through the\nowner's subsurface, the city has to obtain the subsurface rights to do so.\nAn ordinary lease is a common example of the transfer of a portion of one's\nbundle of rights. The owner relinquishes the right to possess portions of the\nsurface, perhaps a building, in return for rent. The tenant enjoys the rights to\npossess and use the building over the term of the lease, after which these rights\nrevert to the landlord. During the lease term, the tenant has no rights to the\nproperty's subsurface or airspace other than what the building occupies. Further,\nthe tenant does not enjoy any of the other rights in the bundle of rights: he\ncannot encumber the property or transfer it. To a limited degree, the tenant may\nexclude persons from the property, but he may not exclude the legal owner.\nSurface rights. Surface rights apply to the real estate contained within the\nsurface boundaries of the parcel. This includes the ground, all natural things\naffixed to the ground, and all improvements. Surface rights also include water\nrights.\nAir rights. Air rights apply to the space above the surface boundaries of the\nparcel, as delineated by imaginary vertical lines extended to infinity. Since the\nadvent of aviation, air rights have been curtailed to allow aircraft to fly over\none's property, provided the overflights do not interfere with the owner's use and\nenjoyment of the property. The issue of violation of air rights for the benefit of\nair transportation is an ongoing battle between airlines, airports, and nearby\nproperty owners.\nSubsurface rights. Subsurface rights apply to land beneath the surface of the\nreal estate parcel extending from its surface boundaries downward to the center\n20 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "of the earth. Notable subsurface rights are the rights to extract mineral and gas\ndeposits and subsurface water from the water table.\nWater rights Water rights basically concern the rights to own and use water found in lakes,\nstreams, rivers, and the ocean. In addition, they determine where parcel\nboundaries can be fixed with respect to adjoining bodies of water. What water\nrights does an owner of a property that contains or adjoins a body of water\nenjoy? The answer depends on three variables:\n\uf034 whether the state controls the water\n\uf034 whether the water is moving\n\uf034 whether the water is navigable\nDoctrine of Prior Appropriation. Since water is a resource necessary for\nsurvival, some states -- particularly those where water is scarce -- have taken the\nlegal position that the state owns and controls all bodies of water. Called the\nDoctrine of Prior Appropriation, this position requires that property owners\nobtain permits for use of water. If a proposed usage is reasonable and beneficial,\nthe state will grant a permit which, over time, can attach to the property of the\npermit holder. If a state does not operate under prior appropriation, it operates\nunder the common law doctrines of littoral rights and riparian rights.\nLittoral rights. Littoral rights concern properties abutting bodies of water that\nare not moving, such as lakes and seas. Owners of properties abutting a\nnavigable, non-moving body of water enjoy the littoral right of use, but do not\nown the water nor the land beneath the water. Ownership extends to the high-\nwater mark of the body of water.\nExhibit 2.4 Littoral Rights\nThe legal premise underlying the definition of littoral rights is that a lake or sea is\na navigable body of water, therefore, public property owned by the state. By\ncontrast, a body of water entirely contained within the boundaries of an owner's\nproperty is not navigable. In such a case, the owner would own the water as well\nas unrestricted rights of usage.\nChapter 2: Rights in Real Estate 21",

    "text": "Littoral rights attach to the property. When the property is sold, the littoral\nrights transfer with the property to the new owner.\nRiparian rights. Riparian rights concern properties abutting moving water such\nas streams and rivers. If a property abuts a stream or river, the owner's riparian\nrights are determined by whether the water is navigable or not navigable. If the\nproperty abuts a non-navigable stream, the owner enjoys unrestricted use of the\nwater and owns the land beneath the stream to the stream's midpoint. If the\nwaterway in question is navigable, the waterway is considered to be a public\neasement. In such a case, the owner's property extends to the water's edge as\nopposed to the midpoint of the waterway. The state owns the land beneath the\nwater.\nExhibit 2.5 Riparian Rights\nOne's riparian rights to use flowing water are subject to the conditions that:\n\uf034 the usage is reasonable and does not infringe on the riparian\nrights of other owners downstream\n\uf034 the usage does not pollute the water\n\uf034 the usage does not impede or alter the course of the water flow.\nLike littoral rights, riparian rights attach to the property.\n22 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "REAL VERSUS PERSONAL\nPROPERTY\nFixtures\nDifferentiation criteria\nTrade fixtures\nEmblements\nFactory-built housing\nConversion\nIn conveying real property, it is vitally important to recognize the distinctions\nbetween personal property and the real property that is to be conveyed.\nConfusion can arise because items of property may be either personal property\nor real property, depending on circumstances.\nThe primary criterion for distinguishing real from personal property is whether\nthe item is permanently attached to the land or to structures attached to the land.\nFor example, a tree growing in one's yard is an item of real property. However,\nwhen the owner cuts the tree down, it becomes personal property. Similarly, a\nswimming pool pump on a shelf in the owner's garage is personal property. When\nit is installed with the rest of the pool, it becomes real property.\nWhile the \"attachment\" criterion is pivotal in distinguishing between real and\npersonal property, there are other tests to be applied. In addition, the\nattachment rule is subject to exceptions.\nFixtures A personal property item that has been converted to real property by\nattachment to real estate is called a fixture. Typical examples are chandeliers,\ntoilets, water pumps, septic tanks, and window shutters.\nThe owner of real property inherently owns all fixtures belonging to the real\nproperty. When the owner sells the real property, the buyer acquires rights to all\nfixtures. Fixtures not included in the sale must be itemized and excluded in the\nsale contract.\nDifferentiation\ncriteria In the event that the attachment criterion is insufficient to determine whether\nan article of property is real or personal, a court may apply one or more of\nthe following additional criteria.\nIntention. One's original intention can override the test of movability in\ndetermining whether an item is a fixture or not. If someone attached an item to\nreal property, yet intended to remove it after a period of time, the article may be\ndeemed personal property. If a person intended an article to be a fixture, even\nthough the item is easily removable, the article may be deemed a fixture.\nFor example, an apartment renter installs an alarm system, fully intending to\nremove the system upon lease expiration. Here, the alarm system would be\nconsidered personal property.\nAdaptation. If an item is uniquely adapted to the property, or the property is\ncustom-designed to accommodate the item, it may be deemed real property\nChapter 2: Rights in Real Estate 23",

    "text": "whether the item is easily removable or not. House keys, a garbage compactor,\nand a removable door screen are examples.\nFunctionality. If an item is vital to the operation of the building, it may be\ndeemed a fixture, even though perhaps easily removable. Window-unit air\nconditioners and detachable solar panels are possible examples.\nRelationship of parties. If a tenant installs a fixture in order to conduct business,\nthe fixture may be considered a trade fixture, which is the tenant's personal\nproperty.\nSale or lease contract provisions. In a sale or lease transaction, the listing of an\nitem in the contract as a personal property item or a fixture overrides all other\nconsiderations. Unless otherwise stated as exceptions, all fixtures are included in\nthe sale. For example, if a sale contract stipulates that the carpeting is not\nincluded in the sale, it becomes a personal property item. If the carpeting is not\nmentioned, it goes with the property, since it is attached to the floor of the\nbuilding.\nTrade fixtures Trade fixtures, or chattel fixtures, are items of a tenant's personal property that\nthe tenant has temporarily affixed to a landlord's real property in order to conduct\nbusiness. Trade fixtures may be detached and removed before or upon surrender\nof the leased premises. Should the tenant fail to remove a trade fixture, it may\nbecome the property of the landlord through accession. Thereafter, the fixture is\nconsidered real property.\nExamples of trade fixtures include a grocer's food freezers, a merchant's clothes\nracks, a tavern owner's bar, a dairy's milking machines, and a printer's printing\npress.\nEmblements Growing plants, including agricultural crops, may be either real property or\npersonal property. Plants and crops that grow naturally without requiring\nanyone's labor or machinery are considered real property.\nPlants and crops requiring human intervention and labor are called emblements.\nEmblements, despite their attachment to land, are considered personal property.\nIf an emblement is owned by a tenant farmer, the tenant has the right to the\nharvested crop whether the tenant's lease is active or expired. If the tenant grew\nthe crop, it is his or her personal property, and the landlord cannot take it.\nFactory-built\nhousing Factory-built housing consists of dwelling units constructed off-site and\ntransported to and assembled on a building site. The category also includes\nreadily moveable housing of the type that can be relocated from place to place,\nonce known by the term mobile home. The National Manufactured Housing\nConstruction and Safety Standards Act of 1976 defined the types of factory-built\nhousing and retired the mobile home designation. Manufactured housing is\nfactory-built housing that conforms to HUD standards. Factory-built housing\nmay be considered real property or personal property, depending on whether it is\npermanently affixed to the ground, and according to state law. Real estate\npractitioners should understand the local laws before selling any kind of factory-\nbuilt housing.\n24 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The classification may be changed by the process of conversion.\nSeverance is the conversion of real property to personal property by detaching it\nfrom the real estate, such as by cutting down a tree, detaching a door from a\nshed, or removing an antenna from a roof. Affixing, or attachment, is the act of\nconverting personal property to real property by attaching it to the real estate,\nsuch as by assembling a pile of bricks into a barbecue pit, or constructing a boat\ndock from wood planks.\nExhibit 2.6 Real Property vs. Personal Property\nReal Property Personal Property\nland trade fixtures\nfixtures emblements\nattachments conversions by severance\nconversions by affixing\nREGULATION OF REAL PROPERTY INTERESTS\nAreas of regulation\nFederal regulation\nState regulation\nLocal regulation\nJudicial regulation\nAlthough the Constitution guarantees private ownership of real estate, laws and\nregulations at every level of government qualify and limit individual real\nproperty ownership and the bundle of rights associated with it.\nAreas of\nregulation Government entities regulate the following aspects of real property interests:\n\uf034 the bundle of rights: possession,\nusage, transfer, encumbering and\nexclusion\n\uf034 legal descriptions\n\uf034 financing\n\uf034 insurance\n\uf034 inheritance\n\uf034 taxation\nChapter 2: Rights in Real Estate 25",

The Environmental Protection Agency establishes\nprotective usage restrictions and guidelines for dealing with hazardous materials\nand other environmental concerns. Federal flood insurance legislation requires\ncertain homeowners to obtain flood insurance policies. Federal laws such as the\nFederal Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibit discrimination in housing based on\nrace, religion, color, or national origin. Such laws as the Americans with\nDisabilities Act prescribe design and accessibility standards.\nThe federal government does not levy real estate taxes.\nState regulation State governments are the primary regulatory entities of the real estate business.\nState governments establish real estate license laws and qualifications. In\naddition, state governments have established real estate commissions to\nadminister license laws and oversee activities of licensees.\nState governments also exert regional influence in the usage and\nenvironmental control of real estate within the state. Relevant state laws\nmight include laws relating to flood zones, waste disposal, drainage control,\nshore preservation, and pollution standards.\nStates also play a role in defining how real property may be owned,\ntransferred, encumbered, and inherited. For example, in some states a\nmortgaged property becomes the legal property of the lender until the\nmortgage loan is paid.\nStates have the power to levy real estate taxes but generally pass this power to\nlocal government.\nLocal regulation County and local government regulation focuses on land use control, control of\nimprovements, and taxation. Land use regulations and ordinances control how\nall property within the jurisdiction may be developed, improved, demolished,\nand managed. County and local governments have the power to zone land, take\nover land for the public good, issue building permits, and establish the rules for\nall development projects.\nCounty and local governments, along with school districts and other local\njurisdictions, have the power to levy real estate taxes.\nJudicial\nregulation The judicial system exerts an influence on real estate ownership and use\nthrough decisions based on case law and common law, as distinguished from\nstatutory law.
