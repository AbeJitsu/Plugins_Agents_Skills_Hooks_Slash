                The classification of an item of property as real or personal is not necessarily fixed. The classification may be changed by the process of conversion. <strong>Severance</strong> is the conversion of real property to personal property by detaching it from the real estate, such as by cutting down a tree, detaching a door from a shed, or removing an antenna from a roof. <strong>Affixing</strong>, or attachment, is the act of converting personal property to real property by attaching it to the real estate, such as by assembling a pile of bricks into a barbecue pit, or constructing a boat dock from wood planks.
