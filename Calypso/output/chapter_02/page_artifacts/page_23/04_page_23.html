            <p>whether the item is easily removable or not. House keys, a garbage compactor, and a removable door screen are examples.</p>

            <h5>Functionality.</h5>
            <p>If an item is vital to the operation of the building, it may be deemed a fixture, even though perhaps easily removable. Window-unit air conditioners and detachable solar panels are possible examples.</p>

            <h5>Relationship of parties.</h5>
            <p>If a tenant installs a fixture in order to conduct business, the fixture may be considered a trade fixture, which is the tenant's personal property.</p>

            <h5>Sale or lease contract provisions.</h5>
            <p>In a sale or lease transaction, the listing of an item in the contract as a personal property item or a fixture overrides all other considerations. Unless otherwise stated as exceptions, all fixtures are included in the sale. For example, if a sale contract stipulates that the carpeting is not included in the sale, it becomes a personal property item. If the carpeting is not mentioned, it goes with the property, since it is attached to the floor of the building.</p>

            <h4>Trade fixtures</h4>
            <p><em>Trade fixtures</em>, or <em>chattel fixtures</em>, are items of a tenant's <em>personal property</em> that the tenant has temporarily affixed to a landlord's real property in order to conduct business. Trade fixtures may be detached and removed before or upon surrender of the leased premises. Should the tenant fail to remove a trade fixture, it may become the property of the landlord through <em>accession</em>. Thereafter, the fixture is considered real property.</p>

            <p>Examples of trade fixtures include a grocer's food freezers, a merchant's clothes racks, a tavern owner's bar, a dairy's milking machines, and a printer's printing press.</p>

            <h4>Emblements</h4>
            <p>Growing plants, including agricultural crops, may be either real property or personal property. Plants and crops that grow naturally without requiring anyone's labor or machinery are considered real property.</p>

            <p>Plants and crops requiring human intervention and labor are called <em>emblements</em>. Emblements, despite their attachment to land, are considered personal property. If an emblement is owned by a tenant farmer, the tenant has the right to the harvested crop whether the tenant's lease is active or expired. If the tenant grew the crop, it is his or her personal property, and the landlord cannot take it.</p>

            <h4>Factory-built housing</h4>
            <p>Factory-built housing consists of dwelling units constructed off-site and transported to and assembled on a building site. The category also includes readily moveable housing of the type that can be relocated from place to place, once known by the term <em>mobile home</em>. The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1976 defined the types of factory-built housing and retired the mobile home designation. <em>Manufactured housing</em> is factory-built housing that conforms to HUD standards. Factory-built housing may be considered real property or personal property, depending on whether it is permanently affixed to the ground, and according to state law. Real estate practitioners should understand the local laws before selling any kind of factory-built housing.</p>
