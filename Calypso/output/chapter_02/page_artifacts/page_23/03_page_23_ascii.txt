│  If an item is vital to the operation of the building, it may be deemed a  │
│  fixture, even though perhaps easily removable. Window-unit air condition- │
│  ers and detachable solar panels are possible examples.                     │

│  If a tenant installs a fixture in order to conduct business, the fixture  │
│  may be considered a trade fixture, which is the tenant's personal property.│
│                                                                             │

│  In a sale or lease transaction, the listing of an item in the contract as │
│  a personal property item or a fixture overrides all other considerations.  │
│  Unless otherwise stated as exceptions, all fixtures are included in the    │
│  sale. For example, if a sale contract stipulates that the carpeting is    │
│  not included in the sale, it becomes a personal property item. If the     │
│  carpeting is not mentioned, it goes with the property, since it is attach-│
│  ed to the floor of the building.                                           │

│  Trade fixtures, or chattel fixtures, are items of a tenant's personal     │
│  property that the tenant has temporarily affixed to a landlord's real     │
│  property in order to conduct business. Trade fixtures may be detached and │
│  removed before or upon surrender of the leased premises. Should the tenant │
│  fail to remove a trade fixture, it may become the property of the landlord │
│  through accession. Thereafter, the fixture is considered real property.    │
│                                                                             │

│  Examples of trade fixtures include a grocer's food freezers, a merchant's │
│  clothes racks, a tavern owner's bar, a dairy's milking machines, and a    │
│  printer's printing press.                                                   │

│  Growing plants, including agricultural crops, may be either real property │
│  or personal property. Plants and crops that grow naturally without requir- │
│  ing anyone's labor or machinery are considered real property.              │
│                                                                             │
│  [Body Text - 11pt Regular with italic emphasis]                           │
│  Plants and crops requiring human intervention and labor are called        │
│  emblements. Emblements, despite their attachment to land, are considered  │
│  personal property. If an emblement is owned by a tenant farmer, the tenant │
│  has the right to the harvested crop whether the tenant's lease is active   │
│  or expired. If the tenant grew the crop, it is his or her personal        │
│  property, and the landlord cannot take it.                                │
│                                                                             │

│  Factory-built housing consists of dwelling units constructed off-site and  │
│  transported to and assembled on a building site. The category also includes│
│  readily moveable housing of the type that can be relocated from place to   │
│  place, once known by the term mobile home. The National Manufactured      │
│  Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1976 defined the types of │
│  factory-built housing and retired the mobile home designation. Manufactured│
│  housing is factory-built housing that conforms to HUD standards. Factory- │
│  built housing may be considered real property or personal property, depend-│
│  ing on whether it is permanently affixed to the ground, and according to   │
│  state law. Real estate practitioners should understand the local laws      │
│  before selling any kind of factory-built housing.                          │
