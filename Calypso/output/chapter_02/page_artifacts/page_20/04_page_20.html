            <p class="paragraph">
                Water rights basically concern the rights to own and use water found in lakes, streams, rivers, and the ocean. In addition, they determine where parcel boundaries can be fixed with respect to adjoining bodies of water. What water rights does an owner of a property that contains or adjoins a body of water enjoy? The answer depends on three variables:

            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Doctrine of Prior Appropriation.</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Since water is a resource necessary for survival, some states -- particularly those where water is scarce -- have taken the legal position that the state owns and controls all bodies of water. Called the Doctrine of Prior Appropriation, this position requires that property owners obtain permits for use of water. If a proposed usage is reasonable and beneficial, the state will grant a permit which, over time, can attach to the property of the permit holder. If a state does not operate under prior appropriation, it operates under the common law doctrines of <em>littoral rights</em> and <em>riparian rights</em>.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Littoral rights -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Littoral rights.</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Littoral rights concern properties abutting bodies of water that are not moving, such as lakes and seas. Owners of properties abutting a navigable, non-moving body of water enjoy the littoral right of use, but do not own the water nor the land beneath the water. Ownership extends to the high-water mark of the body of water.

            </figure>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The legal premise underlying the definition of littoral rights is that a lake or sea is a <em>navigable body of water</em>, therefore, <em>public property</em> owned by the state. By contrast, a body of water entirely contained within the boundaries of an owner's property is not navigable. In such a case, the owner would own the water as well as unrestricted rights of usage.
