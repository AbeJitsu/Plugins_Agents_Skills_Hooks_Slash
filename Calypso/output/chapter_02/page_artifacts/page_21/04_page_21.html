            <p class="paragraph">
                Riparian rights concern properties abutting moving water such as streams and rivers. If a property abuts a stream or river, the owner's riparian rights are determined by whether the water <em>is navigable or not navigable</em>. If the property abuts a non-navigable stream, the owner enjoys unrestricted use of the water and <em>owns the land beneath the stream to the stream's midpoint</em>. If the waterway in question is navigable, the waterway is considered to be a public easement. In such a case, the owner's property extends <em>to the water's edge</em> as opposed to the midpoint of the waterway. The state owns the land beneath the water.
