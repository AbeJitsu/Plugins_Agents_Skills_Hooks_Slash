│  In regulating real property rights, the federal government is primarily   │
│  concerned with broad standards of real property usage, natural disaster,  │
│  land description, and discrimination.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Federal agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration promote and   │
│  regulate home ownership. The Environmental Protection Agency establishes   │
│  protective usage restrictions and guidelines for dealing with hazardous    │
│  materials and other environmental concerns. Federal flood insurance        │
│  legislation requires certain homeowners to obtain flood insurance policies.│
│  Federal laws such as the Federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibit        │
│  discrimination in housing based on race, religion, color, or national     │
│  origin. Such laws as the Americans with Disabilities Act prescribe design │
│  and accessibility standards.                                               │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │

│  State governments are the primary regulatory entities of the real estate  │
│  business. State governments establish real estate license laws and        │
│  qualifications. In addition, state governments have established real      │
│  estate commissions to administer license laws and oversee activities of   │
│  licensees.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │

│  State governments also exert regional influence in the usage and          │
│  environmental control of real estate within the state. Relevant state     │
│  laws might include laws relating to flood zones, waste disposal, drainage │
│  control, shore preservation, and pollution standards.                     │
│                                                                             │

│  States also play a role in defining how real property may be owned,       │
│  transferred, encumbered, and inherited. For example, in some states a     │
│  mortgaged property becomes the legal property of the lender until the     │
│  mortgage loan is paid.                                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  States have the power to levy real estate taxes but generally pass this    │
│  power to local government.                                                 │
│                                                                             │

│  County and local government regulation focuses on land use control, control│
│  of improvements, and taxation. Land use regulations and ordinances control │
│  how all property within the jurisdiction may be developed, improved,      │
│  demolished, and managed. County and local governments have the power to   │
│  zone land, take over land for the public good, issue building permits, and│
│  establish the rules for all development projects.                          │
│                                                                             │

│  County and local governments, along with school districts and other local │
│  jurisdictions, have the power to levy real estate taxes.                   │
│                                                                             │

│  [Body Text - 11pt Regular]                                                │
│  The judicial system exerts an influence on real estate ownership and use   │
│  through decisions based on case law and common law, as distinguished from  │
│  statutory law. Case law consists of decisions based on judicial precedent. │
│  Common law is the collective body of law deriving from custom and         │
│  generally accepted practice in society.                                    │
│                                                                             │
