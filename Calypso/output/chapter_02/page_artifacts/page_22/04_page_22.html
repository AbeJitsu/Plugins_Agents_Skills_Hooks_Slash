            <!-- Introduction Paragraphs -->
            <p class="paragraph">
                In conveying real property, it is vitally important to recognize the distinctions between personal property and the real property that is to be conveyed. Confusion can arise because items of property <em>may be either personal property or real property, depending on circumstances.</em>
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The primary criterion for distinguishing real from personal property is whether the item is permanently attached to the land or to structures attached to the land. For example, a tree growing in one's yard is an item of real property. However, when the owner cuts the tree down, it becomes personal property. Similarly, a swimming pool pump on a shelf in the owner's garage is personal property. When it is installed with the rest of the pool, it becomes real property.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                While the "attachment" criterion is pivotal in distinguishing between real and personal property, there are other tests to be applied. In addition, the attachment rule is subject to exceptions.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Fixtures -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Fixtures</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                A personal property item that has been converted to real property by attachment to real estate is called a fixture. Typical examples are chandeliers, toilets, water pumps, septic tanks, and window shutters.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The owner of real property inherently owns all fixtures belonging to the real property. When the owner sells the real property, the buyer acquires rights to all fixtures. Fixtures not included in the sale must be itemized and excluded in the sale contract.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Differentiation criteria -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Differentiation criteria</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                In the event that the attachment criterion is insufficient to determine whether an article of property is real or personal, a court may apply one or more of the following additional criteria.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Intention -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading"><strong>Intention.</strong></h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                One's original intention can override the test of movability in determining whether an item is a fixture or not. If someone attached an item to real property, yet intended to remove it after a period of time, the article may be deemed personal property. If a person intended an article to be a fixture, even though the item is easily removable, the article may be deemed a fixture.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                For example, an apartment renter installs an alarm system, fully intending to remove the system upon lease expiration. Here, the alarm system would be considered personal property.
            </p>

            <!-- Sub-subsection: Adaptation -->
            <h5 class="subsection-heading"><strong>Adaptation.</strong></h5>

            <p class="paragraph">
                If an item is uniquely adapted to the property, or the property is custom-designed to accommodate the item, it may be deemed real property.
