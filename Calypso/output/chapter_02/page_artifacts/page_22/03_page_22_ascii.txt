│  In conveying real property, it is vitally important to recognize the      │
│  distinctions between personal property and the real property that is to    │
│  be conveyed. Confusion can arise because items of property may be either  │
│  personal property or real property, depending on circumstances.            │
│                                                                             │
│  [Body Text - 11pt Regular]                                                │
│  The primary criterion for distinguishing real from personal property is    │
│  whether the item is permanently attached to the land or to structures      │
│  attached to the land. For example, a tree growing in one's yard is an     │
│  item of real property. However, when the owner cuts the tree down, it     │
│  becomes personal property. Similarly, a swimming pool pump on a shelf in   │
│  the owner's garage is personal property. When it is installed with the    │
│  rest of the pool, it becomes real property.                               │
│                                                                             │

│  While the "attachment" criterion is pivotal in distinguishing between     │
│  real and personal property, there are other tests to be applied. In       │
│  addition, the attachment rule is subject to exceptions.                    │
│                                                                             │

│                                                                             │

│  A personal property item that has been converted to real property by      │
│  attachment to real estate is called a fixture. Typical examples are       │
│  chandeliers, toilets, water pumps, septic tanks, and window shutters.     │
│                                                                             │
│  [Body Text - 11pt Regular]                                                │
│  The owner of real property inherently owns all fixtures belonging to the  │
│  real property. When the owner sells the real property, the buyer acquires │
│  rights to all fixtures. Fixtures not included in the sale must be         │
│  itemized and excluded in the sale contract.                                │
│                                                                             │

│  Differentiation criteria                                                   │
│                                                                             │

│  In the event that the attachment criterion is insufficient to determine   │
│  whether an article of property is real or personal, a court may apply one │
│  or more of the following additional criteria.                              │
│                                                                             │

│  Intention.                                                                 │
│                                                                             │

│  One's original intention can override the test of movability in           │
│  determining whether an item is a fixture or not. If someone attached an   │
│  item to real property, yet intended to remove it after a period of time,  │
│  the article may be deemed personal property. If a person intended an      │
│  article to be a fixture, even though the item is easily removable, the    │
│  article may be deemed a fixture.                                           │
│                                                                             │
│  [Body Text - 11pt Regular with example]                                   │
│  For example, an apartment renter installs an alarm system, fully intending│
│  to remove the system upon lease expiration. Here, the alarm system would  │
│  be considered personal property.                                           │
│                                                                             │

│  Adaptation.                                                                │
│                                                                             │

│  If an item is uniquely adapted to the property, or the property is custom-│
│  designed to accommodate the item, it may be deemed real property.          │
│                                                                             │
