│  On the other hand, the owner may convey all rights to the property        │
│  except the mineral rights.                                                 │

│  While all rights are transferrable, the owner can only transfer what the  │
│  owner in fact possesses. A property seller, for example, cannot sell      │
│  water rights if there are no water rights attached to the property.       │
│                                                                             │

│  The right to encumber the property essentially means the right to         │
│  mortgage the property as collateral for debt. There may be restrictions   │
│  to this right, such as a spouse's right to limit the degree to which a    │
│  homestead may be mortgaged.                                               │
│                                                                             │

│  The right to exclude gives the property owner the legal right to keep     │
│  others off the property and to prosecute trespassers.                     │
│                                                                             │

│  The bundle of real property rights also applies separately to the         │
│  individual components of real estate: the air, the surface, and the       │
│  subsurface. An owner can, for example, transfer subsurface rights without │
│  transferring air rights. Similarly, an owner can rent air space without   │
│  encumbering surface or subsurface rights. This might occur in a city      │
│  where adjoining building owners want to construct a walkway over a third  │
│  owner's lot. Such owners would have to acquire the air rights for the     │
│  walkway. If the city wants to construct a subway through the owner's      │
│  subsurface, the city has to obtain the subsurface rights to do so.        │
│                                                                             │

│  An ordinary lease is a common example of the transfer of a portion of     │
│  one's bundle of rights. The owner relinquishes the right to possess       │
│  portions of the surface, perhaps a building, in return for rent. The      │
│  tenant enjoys the rights to possess and use the building over the term    │
│  of the lease, after which these rights revert to the landlord. During     │
│  the lease term, the tenant has no rights to the property's subsurface or  │
│  airspace other than what the building occupies. Further, the tenant does  │
│  not enjoy any of the other rights in the bundle of rights: he cannot      │
│  encumber the property or transfer it. To a limited degree, the tenant may │
│  exclude persons from the property, but he may not exclude the legal owner.│

│  boundaries of the parcel. This includes the ground, all natural things    │
│  affixed to the ground, and all improvements. Surface rights also include  │
│  water rights.                                                              │

│  Air rights apply to the space above the surface boundaries of the parcel, │
│  as delineated by imaginary vertical lines extended to infinity. Since the │
│  advent of aviation, air rights have been curtailed to allow aircraft to   │
│  fly over one's property, provided the overflights do not interfere with   │
│  the owner's use and enjoyment of the property. The issue of violation of  │
│  air rights for the benefit of air transportation is an ongoing battle     │
│  between airlines, airports, and nearby property owners.                   │
