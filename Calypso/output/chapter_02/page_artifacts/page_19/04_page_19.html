            <p class="paragraph">
                person may sell mineral rights without selling the right of possession. On the other hand, the owner may convey all rights to the property except the mineral rights.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                While all rights are transferrable, the owner can only transfer what the owner in fact possesses. A property seller, for example, cannot sell water rights if there are no water rights attached to the property.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The <em>right to encumber</em> the property essentially means the right to mortgage the property as collateral for debt. There may be restrictions to this right, such as a spouse's right to limit the degree to which a homestead may be mortgaged.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The <em>right to exclude</em> gives the property owner the legal right to keep others off the property and to prosecute trespassers.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The bundle of real property rights also applies separately to the individual components of real estate: the air, the surface, and the subsurface. An owner can, for example, transfer subsurface rights without transferring air rights. Similarly, an owner can rent air space without encumbering surface or subsurface rights. This might occur in a city where adjoining building owners want to construct a walkway over a third owner's lot. Such owners would have to acquire the air rights for the walkway. If the city wants to construct a subway through the owner's subsurface, the city has to obtain the subsurface rights to do so.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                An ordinary lease is a common example of the transfer of a portion of one's bundle of rights. The owner relinquishes the right to possess portions of the surface, perhaps a building, in return for rent. The tenant enjoys the rights to possess and use the building over the term of the lease, after which these rights revert to the landlord. During the lease term, the tenant has no rights to the property's subsurface or airspace other than what the building occupies. Further, the tenant does not enjoy any of the other rights in the bundle of rights: he cannot encumber the property or transfer it. To a limited degree, the tenant may exclude persons from the property, but he may not exclude the legal owner.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Surface rights -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Surface rights.</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Surface rights apply to the real estate contained within the surface boundaries of the parcel. This includes the ground, all natural things affixed to the ground, and all improvements. Surface rights also include water rights.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Air rights -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Air rights.</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Air rights apply to the space above the surface boundaries of the parcel, as delineated by imaginary vertical lines extended to infinity. Since the advent of aviation, air rights have been curtailed to allow aircraft to fly over one's property, provided the overflights do not interfere with the owner's use and enjoyment of the property. The issue of violation of air rights for the benefit of air transportation is an ongoing battle between airlines, airports, and nearby property owners.
            </p>

            <!-- Subsection: Subsurface rights -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Subsurface rights.</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Subsurface rights apply to land beneath the surface of the real estate parcel extending from its surface boundaries downward to the center of the earth.
