            <p>A simple definition of real estate is that it is air, water, land, and everything affixed to the land. Real estate in the United States may be owned privately by individuals and private entities or publicly by government entities. Private ownership rights in this country are not absolute. The government can impose taxes and restrictions on private ownership rights, and it can take private property away altogether. In addition, other private parties can exert their rights and interests on one's real property. A bank, for example, can take a property if the owner fails to pay a mortgage. A neighbor can claim the right to walk across one's property whether the owner likes it or not, provided he or she has done so for a certain number of years.</p>

            <p>In attempting to define real estate, it is essential to understand what rights and interests parties have in a parcel of real estate. And to understand real estate rights and interests, one must first recognize the distinctions between:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>land and real estate</li>
                <li>real estate and property</li>
                <li>real property and personal property</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Land</h4>
            <p>The legal concept of land encompasses</p>

            <ul>
                <li>the surface area of the earth</li>
                <li>everything beneath the surface of the earth extending downward to its center</li>
                <li>all <em>natural</em> things permanently attached to the earth</li>
                <li>the air above the surface of the earth extending outward to infinity.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Land, therefore, includes minerals beneath the earth's surface, water on or below the earth's surface, and the air above the surface. In addition, land includes all</p>
