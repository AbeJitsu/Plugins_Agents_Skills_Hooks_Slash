            <p class="paragraph">
                Our legal system recognizes two classifications of property: <em>real property</em> and <em>personal property</em>. <strong>Real property</strong> is ownership of real estate and the bundle of rights associated with owning the real estate. <strong>Personal property</strong> is ownership of anything which is not real estate, and the rights associated with owning the personal property item. Items of personal property are also called <strong>chattels</strong> or <strong>personalty</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Note: since all real estate in the United States is owned by some person, private organization, or government entity, all real estate in the country <em>is</em> real property. Given that fact, this text will follow the customary practice of using the two terms interchangeably and synonymously.

            <!-- Tangible versus intangible property subsection -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Tangible versus intangible property.</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Real and personal property may be further categorized as <strong>tangible</strong> or <strong>intangible</strong> property. Tangible property is physical, visible, and material. Intangible property is abstract, having no physical existence in itself, other than as evidence of one's ownership interest.

            <p class="paragraph">
                All real estate, by its physical nature, is tangible property. Personal property may be tangible or intangible. Boats, jewelry, coins, appliances, computers, and art work are examples of tangible personal property. Stocks, copyrights, bonds, trademarks, patents, franchises, and listing agreements are examples of intangible personal property.

            <!-- Real property rights subsection -->
            <h4 class="subsection-heading">Real property rights</h4>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Real property rights consist of the bundle of rights associated with owning a parcel of real estate. Foremost of these rights is the right of possession.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The <em>right to use</em> a property refers to the right to use it in certain ways, such as mining, cultivating, landscaping, razing, and building on the property. The right is subject to the limitations of local zoning and the legality of the use. One's right to use may not infringe on the rights of others to use and enjoy their property. For example, an owner may be restricted from constructing a large pond on her property if in fact the pond would pose flooding and drainage hazards to the next door neighbor.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The <em>right to transfer</em> interests in the property includes the right to sell, bequeath, lease, donate, or assign ownership interests. An owner may transfer certain individual rights to the property without transferring total ownership. Also, one may transfer ownership while retaining individual interests. For example, a property owner may lease the property to another person while retaining the title to the property itself.
