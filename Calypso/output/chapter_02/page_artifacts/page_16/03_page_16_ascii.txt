│  Land has three unique physical characteristics: immobility,               │
│  indestructibility, and heterogeneity.                                     │
│                                                                             │

│  Land is immobile, since a parcel of land cannot be moved from one site    │
│  to another. In other words, the geographical location of a tract of land  │
│  is fixed and cannot be changed. One can transport portions of the land    │
│  such as mined coal, dirt, or cut plants. However, as soon as such         │
│  elements are detached from the land, they are no longer considered land.  │
│                                                                             │

│  Land is indestructible in the sense that one would have to remove a       │
│  segment of the planet all the way to the core in order to destroy it.     │
│  Even then, the portion extending upward to infinity would remain. For     │
│  the same reason, land is considered to be permanent.                      │
│                                                                             │

│  Land is non-homogeneous, since no two parcels of land are exactly the     │
│  same. Admittedly, two adjacent parcels may be very similar and have the   │
│  same economic value. However, they are inherently different because each  │
│  parcel has a unique location.                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  Real estate therefore includes, in addition to land, such things as       │
│  fences, streets, buildings, wells, sewers, sidewalks and piers. Such     │
│  man-made structures attached to the land are called improvements. The     │
│  phrase "permanently attached" refers primarily to one's intention in      │
│  attaching the item. Obviously, very few if any manmade structures can be  │
│  permanently attached to the land in the literal sense. But if a person    │
│  constructs a house with the intention of creating a permanent dwelling,   │
│  the house is considered real estate. By contrast, if a camper affixes a   │
│  tent to the land with the intention of moving it to another camp in a     │
│  week, the tent would not be considered real estate.                       │
