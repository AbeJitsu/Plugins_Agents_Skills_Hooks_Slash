Its two dimensions are the probability of\noccurrence and the extent of exposure to monetary or non-monetary\nconsequences. Since most risks are related to judgments and decisions, the real\nestate licensee, who makes numerous complex decisions every day, faces a high\ndegree of risk potential.\nRisk management is a structured approach to dealing with the uncertainties and\nconsequences of risk. In real estate practice, the aim is to reduce risk to an\nacceptable level through anticipation and planning.\nRISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES\nAvoidance\nReduction\nTransference\nRetention\nFour well-established strategies for managing risk are:\n\uf034 Avoidance (elimination)\n\uf034 Reduction (mitigation, sharing)\n\uf034 Transference (outsourcing, insuring)\n\uf034 Retention (acceptance and budgeting)\nNot all of these strategies are always possible or available, but a real estate firm\nor licensee who fails to make a conscious effort to employ one or more of them\nincreases the likelihood of loss from the many potential risks that are always\npresent in the real estate business.\nAvoidance Avoidance includes refraining from an activity that carries risk. One can avoid\nthe risks of being in an automobile accident by not riding in automobiles.\nAvoiding risks also means missing the opportunity to benefit from the avoided\nactivity. By avoiding automobile travel, one is confined to modes of\ntransportation, such as buses and walking, that do not offer the same high degree\nof personal freedom and efficiency. Complete avoidance of risk in real estate\npractice is almost impossible. A broker, for instance, may believe that hiring only\nexperienced affiliates eliminates the risk that affiliates will commit license law\nviolations. However, even experienced practitioners may not know the law, and,\nsometimes, people break the law deliberately. The risk may be reduced, but it\nremains.\n358 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Reduction Reduction involves taking steps to reduce the probability or the severity of a\npotential loss. However, this strategy may result in reducing risk in one area only\nto increase it in another. A familiar example is a sprinkler system that dispenses\nwater to reduce the risk of fire but at the same time increases the risk of water\ndamage.\nIn real estate practice, one risk reduction tactic is to share responsibility for\nmaking a decision. The agent provides the consumer with expertise, and perhaps\nsome advice, but lets the consumer decide how much to offer. In this way, the\nagent gets some relief from the risks inherent in the buyer\u2019s decision to purchase.\nTransference Transference means passing the risk to another party, by contract or other means.\nAn insurance policy is the common example, but sometimes the wording of a\nsales or personal services contract can transfer risk without resorting to insurance.\nIn the real estate business, transference is typically and most successfully\naccomplished by means of an errors and omissions (E&O) insurance policy,\neither on the individuals in a firm or on the firm itself. State law may require such\ninsurance.\nRetention Retention of risk means entering into an activity in spite of known risks and\ntaking full responsibility for the consequences. This is, in effect, self-insurance,\nthe only strategy left when risk cannot be reduced or transferred and one has\ndecided not to avoid it because of the desirability of the potential benefits.\nExhibit 22.1 Risk Management Strategies and Procedures\nChapter 22: Risk Management 359",

When agents are familiar with\nthe forms provided by the office, how and when to complete them and where to\nsend them, the likelihood of errors is reduced. Likewise, agents need to be able to\nidentify and understand common contract elements, complete contract forms\ndeveloped by attorneys, and evaluate offers received from co-op agents on their\nlistings without committing a license violation or breach of law.\nIn most states, brokers have a legal obligation to provide training to affiliated\nlicensees. Licensees also have the obligation to seek out appropriate education and\ntraining outside the brokerage to ensure that they know how to comply with the\nlaw. In addition, licensees must satisfy legal requirements for continuing\neducation, while those who care about personal excellence will seek further\neducation and training to enhance their professional skills.\nDisclosure By ensuring that all parties have the information they are entitled to, proper\ndisclosure reduces the risk that clients and customers will accuse a licensee of\nmisleading or inducing them to make a decision with incomplete information.\nFurther, laws in every state require disclosures of one kind or another.\nDisclosure may be made in writing or verbally and may or may not require\nwritten acknowledgment from the receiving party.\nRequired disclosures usually include:\n\uf034 agency relationships\n\uf034 property condition\n\uf034 duties and obligations\n\uf034 personal interest in the transaction\n\uf034 personal interest in referrals\nDocumentation and\nRecord keeping Documentation provides evidence of compliance with laws and regulations.

A written and uniformly enforced company policy lets everyone\nin the firm know what to expect before problems arise. The policy manual should\ncover the company\u2019s rules in such areas as floor duty privileges, assignment of\nrelocation properties to agents, referrals between agents within the company, and\nrequirements for continuing education, sales meeting participation, and property\ntours.\nProcedures manual. A company procedures manual should spell out how to\nhandle every aspect of the company\u2019s business that agents and brokers need to\nknow\u2014from handling consumers\u2019 funds and documents, conducting consumer\ntransactions, dealing with MLS-related matters, and placing signage, to all\nprocedures prescribed by state or federal law, especially license, banking and fair\nhousing laws. Adherence to a procedures manual reduces the risk that an\nindividual will inadvertently commit an unlawful act. Whenever changes are\nmade to the policy or procedures manual, each agent should sign the revised\nmanual as evidence that the agent has examined it.\nStandard forms. Standard forms save time and protect against the unauthorized\npractice of law. Since they are most often prepared by lawyers familiar with the\nmarket area, they can address contingencies that are common in the area in a\nmanner that reflects the real estate laws of the state. On the other hand, a licensee\noften needs to adapt a standardized form for a client by assisting with filling in\nblanks, modifying terms, and attaching addenda. The licensee must always\nremain aware of the limitations the state has placed on such activities.\nHere are a few of the standard forms a brokerage should provide for its agents\nand affiliates:\n\uf034 buyer and seller representation agreements\n\uf034 agreement to show property\n\uf034 purchase and sale agreement\n\uf034 agency disclosure form\n\uf034 property condition disclosure, disclaimer, and exemption form\n\uf034 lease agreement\n\uf034 personal interest disclosure form\n\uf034 referral for service disclosure form\n\uf034 lead-based paint disclosure form\n\uf034 special disclosure forms (mold, radon, subsurface sewage system,\nimpact fees/adequate facilities taxes, etc.)\n\uf034 referral agreement\n\uf034 independent contractor agreement\n\uf034 closing checklist\nChapter 22: Risk Management 361",

A transaction checklist is a good tool for managing risk associated\nwith the failure to make required communications to all principals and for\nkeeping track of required communications from co-op agents.\nRetaining evidence that information has been communicated is a necessary\nprocedure. Electronic communications should be archived on suitable electronic\nmedia. Copies of mailed or faxed communications should be maintained in the\ntransaction folder.\nIt is always difficult to document telephone or face-to-face conversations,\nespecially with the constant use of cell phones from a variety of locations.

Some\nof these types are also used to manage certain risks of brokers and licensees.\nGeneral Liability. General liability insurance provides coverage for risks\nincurred by a property owner when the public or a licensee enters the owned\nproperty (public liability). The insurer pays the covered claim and legal fees,\ncosts, and expenses, including medical expenses, resulting from owner\nnegligence or other causes. This type of insurance does not cover professional\nliability, for which an Errors & Omissions policy is necessary.\nErrors and Omissions. Professional liability is of two general types:\n1. Unprofessional conduct \u2013 a claim that one has failed to carry\nout fiduciary duties and provide an acceptable standard of\ncare\n2. Breach of contract \u2013 a claim that one has failed to perform\nservices under the terms of a contract in a timely manner\nThe primary method for transferring the professional liability risks of brokers,\nmanagers, and licensees is Errors & Omissions (E&O) insurance.

The risks of property damage caused by fire, wind, hail,\nsmoke, civil disturbance, and other such causes are covered by fire and hazard\ninsurance.\nFlood. The risks of property damage caused by floods, heavy rains, snow,\ndrainage failures, and failed public infrastructures such as dams and levies are\ncovered by a specialized flood policy.

    "text": "Agency The risks of agency will occur in one of two areas:\n\uf034 the requirement to inform and disclose\n\uf034 the requirement to carry out an agency duty.\nMost states require agency relationships to be in writing and to be disclosed to all\nparties to a transaction. State law may spell out agency duties, or the duties may\nbe a part of general agency law. In states that do not use agency, there is still the\nobligation to explain and disclose the nature of the relationship.\nDisclosure requirements. A licensee may be acting in a transaction as\nfacilitator, agent, subagent, designated agent, single agent, dual agent, non-agent\nor in some capacity. Regardless of status, the licensee must follow state\ndisclosure requirements. These are, typically, to:\n\uf034 disclose status verbally to other licensees on initial contact\n\uf034 disclose status verbally to buyer and seller before providing real\nestate services\n\uf034 confirm the disclosure in writing before signing a listing agreement\nor presenting a purchase offer (to an unrepresented seller) or before\npreparing a purchase offer (to an unrepresented buyer)\n\uf034 get a signed receipt indicating the written disclosure has been made\nCarrying out the duties of agency also require disclosures of :\n\uf034 personal interest the agent has in a transaction (such as owner or\nbuyer)\n\uf034 personal benefit the agent will derive from a service referral\n\uf034 required property and market information\n\uf034 information about customers a client is entitled to have\nDuties. A licensee who acts for a principal in a real estate transaction is required\nby law to assume certain responsibilities toward the parties to the transaction.\nWhether a state applies the fiduciary duties of agency law or specifies its own\nduties toward clients and consumers, the basic duties remain:\nTo all parties\n\uf034 honesty\n\uf034 fairness\n\uf034 reasonable care and skill\n\uf034 disclosures\nTo clients\n\uf034 skill\n\uf034 care\n\uf034 diligence\n\uf034 loyalty\n\uf034 obedience\n\uf034 confidentiality\n\uf034 accounting\n\uf034 full disclosure\nChapter 22: Risk Management 365",

    "text": "The duty to exercise skill, care and diligence means that licensees may not be\ncasual or negligent in their actions. Licensee negligence is actionable when\nprincipals are harmed by the licensee\u2019s failure.\nThe duty of loyalty requires the agent to put the client\u2019s interests above those of\neveryone else, including his or her own.\nThe duty of obedience requires the agent to act on the principal\u2019s wishes\nregarding the transaction as long as they do not result in any illegal action. The\nduty of obedience never overrides the legal obligation of agents to deal fairly and\nhonestly with all parties.\nThe duty of confidentiality requires the agent to hold in confidence any\ninformation that would harm the client\u2019s interests or bargaining position or\nanything else the client wishes to keep secret, unless the law requires disclosure.\nThe duty of confidentiality survives the termination of the listing contract.\nThe duty of accounting applies to all funds involved in a real estate transaction.\nAccounts must be maintained as required by law, and escrow funds are to be\nhandled strictly in accordance with the law.\nThe duty of disclosure applies to both parties to a transaction, although usually\nwith some differences. Proper disclosure to customers primarily concerns agency,\nproperty condition, and environmental hazards. To the client, it generally\nconcerns all known facts regarding the property and the transaction, including\ninformation about the other transaction party. State laws prescribe what may,\nmust, and must not be disclosed. Licensees must be vigilant to avoid oversights\nand conflicts of interest that can lead to a disclosure to the wrong party or\ndisclosure of information that is confidential.\nConflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest arise when an agent forgets to put the\nbest interests of a client ahead of those of everyone else. This can happen in\nsituations involving undisclosed dual agencies, broker-owned listings, licensees\nbuying for their own account, vendor referrals, and property management\nsubcontracting of services, among many others. Even ordinary, everyday\ntransactions carry a built-in risk of conflict of interest. Consider the fact that a\nlicensee usually receives no compensation for a failed transaction. Therefore, it is\nin the licensee\u2019s interest to see the transaction completed, even if it may not be in\nthe client\u2019s best interest. A negative result from a home inspection or other test\nhas the potential to cause a buyer to back out of a contract. A licensee who has\nforgotten whose best interest should be primary might be tempted to recommend\ninspectors who will overlook problems in exchange for receiving\nreferrals. Licensees must always disclose any self-interest they have in a\ntransaction, and always remember their duties to clients and consumers.\nConfidentiality. Licensees have a responsibility to maintain the confidentiality\nof certain kinds of information they obtain concerning clients and customers.\nThe duty to maintain confidentiality generally survives the termination of a\nlisting agreement into perpetuity. If it seems that revealing confidential\ninformation might benefit the client, the licensee should obtain the client\u2019s\nwritten permission to proceed.\n366 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Public information, such as\nthat contained in public records, information that becomes known without the\nlicensee\u2019s participation, or that the client reveals to another, is not considered\nconfidential.\nState laws often require businesses to provide security for the personal\ninformation they obtain about consumers. Security procedures should protect\npersonal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or\ndisclosure. Confidential information, when it is not to be retained, must be\ndisposed of in a secure manner.\nPenalties. Possible penalties for breach of agency relationships include:\n\uf034 rescission of transaction\n\uf034 loss of compensation\n\uf034 fees and costs\n\uf034 punitive damages\n\uf034 ethics discipline\n\uf034 license discipline\nProperty\ndisclosures Property condition. Most states require the seller of a residential property to\ndeliver to the buyer a written disclosure or disclaimer about the property\u2019s\ncondition, including any material defects the owner knows about. The disclosure\nis usually required before any purchase contract is accepted.. A second disclosure\nmay be required at closing. The licensee should always obtain the parties\u2019\nsignatures acknowledging receipt of these disclosures.\nDepending on the state, the licensee may have no further duty to disclose\nproperty condition after properly informing parties of their rights and obligations.\nHowever, the licensee may still be subject to legal action for\n\uf034 deliberately distorting the facts (intentional misrepresentation)\n\uf034 cheating any party (fraud)\n\uf034 concealing or failing to disclose adverse facts which the licensee\nknew about or should have known about (intentional or\nunintentional misrepresentation)\nLead-based paint and other disclosures. Federal law requires sellers of houses\nbuilt before 1978 to make a lead-based paint disclosure before accepting an offer\nto purchase. The licensee must tell the seller about this requirement, give the\nseller the proper disclosure form, and make sure that the buyer receives it.\nThe licensee must also make sure the seller discloses any other circumstances the\nsituation and the law require, which may include:\n\uf034 wood infestation inspection report\n\uf034 soil test report\n\uf034 subsurface sewage disposal system permit disclosure\n\uf034 impact fees or adequate facilities taxes disclosure\nChapter 22: Risk Management 367",

In most states, a listing\nagreement is enforceable only if it is in writing. Most states forbid net listings,\nbecause they violate the requirement that a valid listing agreement must specify a\nselling price and the agent\u2019s compensation. The licensee, in accordance with the\nduty of due diligence, must verify the accuracy of the statements in the listing\nregarding the property, the owner, and the owner's representations. Especially\nimportant facts for a broker or agent to verify are:\n\uf034 the property condition\n\uf034 ownership status\n\uf034 the client's authority to act\nAn agent who does not to act with a reasonable degree of due diligence in these\nmatters may be exposed to liability if it turns out that the property is not as\nrepresented or the client cannot perform the contract as promised.\nComparative Market Analysis (CMA). In preparing a Comparative Market\nAnalysis, licensees should guard against using the terms \u201cappraisal\u201d and \u201cvalue,\u201d\nwhich are reserved for the use of certified appraisers. Misuse of these terms could\nlead to a charge of misrepresenting oneself as an appraiser. In discussing listed\nproperties with clients or customers, real estate licensees should be careful to use\nguarded terms such as \u201crecommended listing price,\u201d \u201crecommended purchase\nprice,\u2019 and \u201crecommended listing price range.\u201d\nAgents should make every effort to help the sellers find a reasonable listing price\nbased on the current market. If the CMA leads the seller to list at a price that is\ntoo high, the seller may blame the agent when the transaction fails because of an\nappraisal that comes in below the selling price. To minimize this risk, it is best to\nbe conservative in the CMA and retain documentation that the seller went above\nthe recommended price in spite of the agent\u2019s advice.\nEstimate of Closing Costs. In preparing an estimate of closing costs for a seller\nor buyer, there is the risk of forgetting something, leading to an unpleasant\nsurprise when the consumer suddenly faces unexpected costs or conditions.\nLicensees should use their broker\u2019s form, if there is one, and make it clear to the\nconsumer that it is only an estimate of likely costs, not a statement of actual\ncosts. In some states, brokers and agents do not prepare closing cost estimates,\nleaving that task to the lender.\nAdvertising. State and federal laws regulate advertising, including the federal\nFair Housing laws as they pertain to discriminatory advertising and providing of\nservices. Advertising includes electronic communication, social\nmedia/networking, and internet marketing. Usage must be consistent with\ncompany image and legal requirements.

It is\nespecially necessary for paperwork and documentation to be accurate and concise\nin a situation where a fair housing issue could arise.\nAdvertising. The Fair Housing Act forbids real estate advertising that mentions\nrace, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status in any way\nthat suggests preference or discrimination. State laws may add other protected\ncategories, such as creed and age.\nRisk can be reduced by the use of street names or other non-biased geographical\nreferences when stating where the property is located, and by describing the\nproperty rather than the type of persons who might live in or around it. Even if a\nhome appears \u201cideal for a young family,\" it is best not to advertise it as such.\nSuch advertising would exclude other groups such as singles, the elderly, and\nolder families.\nIn advertising the sale or rental of housing covered by the Fair Housing Act, HUD\nrecommends using the Fair Housing Logo or phrase \"Equal Housing Opportunity.\"\nAnswering questions. When faced with questions that might lead to a steering\ncharge or other violation of fair housing laws, it is best for the licensee to limit the\nresponse to features of the home and to the process of selling, buying, and listing\nproperties, and refer the questioner to someone else to answer questions about\nsuch matters as the demographic make-up of the neighborhood. It is illegal for the\nlicensee to voice an opinion based on race, religion, color, creed, national origin,\nsex, handicap, elderliness, or familial status. The agent should explain this fact to\nthe buyer and be wary of any situation where the agent\u2019s behavior might be\nconstrued as discriminatory.\nListing agreements. Before entering into a listing agreement, a licensee should\nexplain that it is necessary to comply with fair housing laws and obtain the\npotential client\u2019s acknowledgment and agreement. The agent should make it clear\nthat the agent will\n\uf034 reject the use of terms indicating race, religion, creed, color,\nnational origin, sex, handicap, age or familial status to describe\nprospective buyers.\n\uf034 terminate the listing if the seller uses race, religion, creed, color,\nnational origin, sex, handicap, age, or familial status in the\nconsideration of an offer.\n\uf034 inform the broker if the seller makes any attempt to discriminate\nillegally.\nChapter 22: Risk Management 371",

    "text": "Offers. A seller cannot refuse to sell a property to an individual based on the\nindividual\u2019s belonging to a protected class, and if this is attempted, the real estate\nprofessional must not be involved. If the seller asks about the color, religion,\ncreed, national origin, ethnicity, age, or familial status of a buyer, the agent must\nexplain that it is illegal to give out such information. The best risk reduction\nprocedure is to treat all buyers and sellers equally, showing no preference for one\nover another.\nAntitrust Antitrust laws forbid brokers to band together to set a price on their services in\nlisting and selling property. Even being overheard discussing commission rates or\nbeing present at such a conversation can lead to charges of price fixing.\nThe law recognizes that some cooperative arrangements between firms \u2013 such as\njoint development projects \u2013 may help consumers by allowing these firms to\ncompete more effectively against each other. Even so the government does not\nprosecute all agreements between companies, but only those that will raise prices\nfor the public or deny the public new and better products.\nSherman Antitrust Act. The Sherman Antitrust Act makes illegal all contracts,\nagreements, and conspiracies among competitors that would unfairly restrict\ninterstate trade by fixing prices, rigging bids, or other means. An unlawful\nmonopoly is created when one company becomes the only supplier of a product or\nservice by getting rid of competition via secret agreements with other companies.\nClayton Act. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions that are likely to\nlessen competition and increase prices to consumers. The Act also prohibits\ncertain other business practices that under certain circumstances may harm\ncompetition. Private parties injured by an antitrust violation may sue in federal\ncourt for three times their actual damages, plus court costs and attorneys' fees.\nFederal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Trade Commission Act forbids\nunfair competition in interstate commerce but establishes no criminal penalties.\nEnforcement. Federal antitrust laws are enforced in three main ways:\n\uf034 the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) brings\ncriminal and civil enforcement actions\n\uf034 the FTC brings civil enforcement actions\n\uf034 private parties bring lawsuits claiming damages\nTo collect evidence, Department of Justice lawyers often work with the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI) on court-authorized searches of a business,\nmonitoring phone calls and employing informants equipped with secret listening\ndevices.\nState attorneys general may sue under the Clayton Act on behalf of injured\nconsumers in their states, and groups of consumers often bring lawsuits on their\nown.\n372 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

A licensee may be sued by the Department of Justice,\nFederal Trade Commission, a state real estate commission, a human rights\ncommission, another licensee or firm, or an individual consumer. Licensees are\nmainly sued for:\n\uf034 fair housing violations\n\uf034 antitrust violations\n\uf034 license law and other state law violations\n\uf034 breach of contract\n\uf034 agency duty violations\n\uf034 illegal practice of law\n\uf034 failures to disclose\n\uf034 customer or client dissatisfaction\n\uf034 fraud\n\uf034 theft\nMisrepresentation Misrepresentation may be unintentional or intentional.\nUnintentional misrepresentation. This type of misrepresentation occurs when a\nlicensee unknowingly conveys inaccurate information to a consumer concerning a\nproperty, financing or agency service. False or inaccurate information that the\nlicensee, as a professional, should have known to be false or inaccurate may be\nincluded in the definition. Those found guilty generally have to pay fines and\nmay be disciplined by state real estate regulators and professional organizations.\nRisky areas for unintentional misrepresentation include:\n\uf034 making and reporting measurements\n\uf034 describing property\n\uf034 offering opinions about future growth and development of a\nneighborhood or neighboring property\n\uf034 making declarative statements about the presence or absence of\nhazardous materials\nThe risks of unintentional misrepresentation are reduced if an agent\n\uf034 learns to measure and calculate areas accurately\n\uf034 relies on measurements reported by others only with extreme\ncaution and specific disclaimers\n\uf034 refrains from exaggeration\n\uf034 avoids stating opinions a consumer might take for expertise\nIntentional misrepresentation. Also known as fraud, this kind of\nmisrepresentation occurs when a licensee knowingly conveys false information\nabout a property, financing or service. Fraud is a criminal act that may result in\nfines and incarceration, in addition to discipline from state regulators and\nprofessional organizations.\nRecommending\nproviders There are several risks attending the recommendation of vendors and service\nproviders to a consumer. First, the consumer may not be satisfied with the\nperformance of the recommended party and blame the licensee. Second, in cases\nwhere a recommended provider performs illegal acts, there may be legal\n374 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "consequences for the licensee. Third, if a licensee has a business relationship with\na recommended vendor or provider and neglects to disclose the fact, there are\nlicense violation consequences.\nThe major risk management technique is to shift the responsibility for choosing a\nvendor to the consumer. This can be done by refusing to recommend vendors at\nall; by presenting a broad range of choices and allowing the consumer to select;\nor by presenting a short list of thoroughly vetted vendors and allowing the\nconsumer to make the decision, always with the disclaimer that to the best of the\nlicensee\u2019s knowledge, the vendors on the list are competent and honest, but that\nthe consumer is responsible for investigating and making his or her own\njudgment before hiring or buying.\nFinancing and\nclosing In the financing and closing phases of a transaction, a consumer may feel that a\nlicensee has been incompetent or misleading. Licensees have an obligation to\ninform and educate their clients throughout the transaction process. Surprises and\naccusations of incompetence or misrepresentation are among possible results of\nfailing to keep the party informed.\nDiscrimination. Of course, it is important to comply with relevant laws.\nLicensees must be mindful of the requirements of ECOA and refrain from\nparticipating in any manner of discriminatory lending. It is illegal to:\n\uf034 threaten, coerce, intimidate or interfere with a person who is\nexercising a fair housing right or assisting another other to exercise\nthat right.\n\uf034 indicate a limitation or preference based on race, color, national\norigin, religion, sex, familial status, or handicap in any\nadvertisement or communication. Single-family and owner-\noccupied housing that is otherwise exempt from the Fair Housing\nAct is subject to this prohibition against discriminatory\nadvertising.\nProgress reporting. All inspections and tests must comply with local and state\nlaws and with the purchase contract. Progress reports should be accurate, timely,\nin writing, and free of speculation. If a consumer has a question about the\nmeaning of something in an inspection report, the licensee should refer the\nconsumer to the person who wrote the report rather than trying to explain it. This\nmethod transfers some of the risk inherent in interpreting the report.\nQualifying buyers. Many transactions fail because a buyer has been improperly\nqualified before the offer is presented. Using a lender to qualify the buyer saves\ntime and protects the agent against leading a seller to believe a purchaser is fully\nqualified when this may not be the case. Also, lenders and loan agents are better\nable to look into the buyer\u2019s qualifications than a real estate licensee is. If it\nbecomes necessary to show a property to a potential buyer who has not been\nqualified by a lender, the licensee can gain some protection by performing an\ninformal qualification and documenting the fact that it was based on the\ninformation provided by the buyer. The buyer\u2019s signature on this documentation\nChapter 22: Risk Management 375",

The licensee should explain loan fees, charges,\namounts, timing, and responsibilities. Agents can assist in the loan decision by\nexplaining how to compare loans with differing charges and interest rates. The\nfact that a high origination fee and points may make a loan with a low interest\nrate unattractive to a borrower is important information for the agent to provide,\nand providing it may protect the agent against a later complaint that the buyer\nsuffered a loss because of the agent\u2019s failure to inform.\nAppraisal problems. Delays and appraised value are the typical problem areas.\nFailure to inform parties about delays can compromise the transaction. An under-\nappraisal will require the buyer to make a larger down payment or the seller to\nlower the price. If the property appraises for more than the purchase price, the\nseller may blame the agent for suggesting the lower price. In such a case, the\nseller\u2019s agent\u2019s defense is that the seller agreed to the listing price and that the\nprice was a factor in attracting the buyer to the property.\nRESPA Violations. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)\nstipulates that the parties to certain purchase transactions must be given accurate\ninformation reflecting their closing costs. It also prohibits certain business\npractices that are not considered to be in the consumer\u2019s best interest.\nThe licensee\u2019s risks regarding RESPA primarily relate to\n\uf034 failing to ensure that the consumer is informed about his or\nher rights under the law\n\uf034 giving or receiving an illegal kickback.\nRESPA currently requires lenders to:\n\uf034 give a copy of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau loan\ninformation booklet to the applicant. The booklet explains\nRESPA provisions, general settlement costs, and the required\nClosing Disclosure form. The lender must provide the estimate of\nclosing costs within three business days following the borrower's\napplication.\n\uf034 give the applicant a Loan Estimate (Form H-24) of expected\nclosing costs within three business days of receiving the\napplication. Actual closing costs may not vary from the estimate\nbeyond certain limits.\n\uf034 give the buyer the Closing Disclosure (Form H-25) specifying\ncosts to be paid by buyer and seller at closing three business days\nbefore consummation.\n\uf034 give the buyer the opportunity to review the final settlement\nstatement one business day prior to closing.\n376 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Those laws usually state that a broker must hold money\nreceived in connection with the purchase or lease of real property in a trust fund\naccount. The type of account and financial depository are specified. The broker\nmust record receipt of the money and place that money in the trust account within\na specified time period.

It is important for the broker to remove commissions,\nfees or other income earned by the broker from a trust account within the period\nspecified by law to avoid committing an act of commingling.\nChapter 22: Risk Management 377",
