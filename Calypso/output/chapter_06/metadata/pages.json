More\naccurately, someone who possesses all ownership interests owns legal title to the\nproperty. Legal title is distinct from equitable title, which is the interest or right\nto obtain legal title to a property in accordance with a sale or mortgage contract\nbetween the legal owner and a buyer or creditor. During the contractual period of\ntime when ownership of legal title is contingent upon the contract, the buyer or\nlender owns equitable title to the property.\nFor example, a buyer enters into a contract for deed to purchase a house. The\nseller lends the bulk of the purchase price to the buyer for a term of three years.\nThe buyer takes possession of the property, and makes payments on the loan.\nDuring this period, the seller retains legal title, and the buyer owns equitable\ntitle. If the buyer fulfills the terms of the agreement over the three year period,\nthe buyer has an enforceable contract to obtain legal title.\nAnother common example is a mortgage loan transaction that gives the lender\nthe right to execute a strict foreclosure, which transfers legal title to the lender\nin the event of a default. With this contractual right, the lender has equitable\ntitle to the property.\n.\nIn practice, the terms \"title\" and \"legal title\" are often used interchangeably.\nNotice of title In any legal system that permits private ownership of real property, there will always\nbe disputes as to who truly owns a particular parcel of real estate. For example,\nan owner might \"sell\" his property to three unrelated parties. The first party buys\nthe property at the earliest date, the second party pays the highest price, and the\nthird party receives the best deed, a warranty deed. Who owns legal title to the\nproperty?\nChapter 6: Transferring and Recording Title 73",

    "text": "Ownership of legal title is a function of evidence. A court will generally rule that\nthe person who has the preponderance of evidence of ownership is the owner of\nthe property. In the example, if the first two buyers did not receive a deed while\nthe third party did, the third party may have the best evidence and be ruled the\nlegal title-holder. However, what if the first buyer had moved into the house and\noccupied it for six months before the original owner sold the property to the\nsecond and third buyers? And what if the second buyer, after searching title\nrecords, reports that the seller never really owned the property and therefore\ncould not legally sell it to anyone! Now who owns the property?\nThe illustration underscores the difficulty of proving title to real estate: there is\nno absolute and irrefutable proof that a party holds legal title. Our legal system\nhas developed two forms of title evidence-- actual notice and constructive\nnotice-- to assist in the determination.\nActual notice. The term \"notice\" is synonymous with \"knowledge.\" A person\nwho has received actual notice has actual knowledge of something. Receiving\nactual notice means learning of something through direct experience or\ncommunication. In proving real estate ownership, a person provides actual\nnotice by producing direct evidence, such as by showing a valid will. Another\nparty receives actual notice by seeing direct evidence, such as by reviewing the\ndeed, reading title records, or physically visiting the property to see who is in\npossession. Thus if Mary Pierce drives to a property and sees directly that John\nDoe is in possession of the home, Mary then has received actual notice of John\nDoe's claim of ownership. Her knowledge is obtained through direct\nexperience.\nConstructive notice. Constructive notice, or legal notice, is knowledge of a\nfact that a person could have or should have obtained. The foremost method of\nimparting constructive notice is by recordation of ownership documents in\npublic records, specifically, title records. Since public records are open to\neveryone, the law generally presumes that when evidence of ownership is\nrecorded, the public at large has received constructive notice of ownership. By\nthe same token, the law presumes that the owner of record is in fact the legal\nowner. Thus, if John Doe records the deed of conveyance, he has imparted, and\nMary Pierce has received, constructive notice of ownership. Possession of the\nproperty can also be construed as constructive notice, since a court may rule\nthat Mary should have visited the property to ascertain whether it was occupied.\nA combination of actual and constructive notice generally provides the\nmost indisputable evidence of real property ownership.\nTransferring title Transfer of title to real estate, also called alienation, occurs voluntarily and\ninvoluntarily. When the transfer uses a written instrument, the transfer is\ncalled a conveyance.\n74 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The most common deeds are statutory deeds, in which the covenants\nare defined in law and do not need to be fully stated in the deed. The prominent\ntypes are the following.\nBargain and sale deed.

The deed is technically a bargain and\nsale deed in which the grantor promises to defend against any and all claims to\nthe title.\nThe overall general warranty covenant is: \"I own and will defend.\"\nSpecial warranty deed. In a special warranty deed, the grantor warrants only\nagainst title defects or encumbrances not noted on the deed that may have\noccurred during the grantor's period of ownership or trusteeship. The deed does\nnot protect the grantee against claims that predate the owner's period of\nownership.

A quitclaim deed transfers real and potential interests in a\nproperty, whether an interest is known to exist or not. The grantor makes no\nclaim to any interest in the property being conveyed and offers no warrants to\nprotect the grantee.\nThe quitclaim is typically used to clear title rather than convey it.

If the decedent died with a valid will, the court hears the\nclaims of lienors and creditors and determines their validity. First in line are\nthe superior liens: those for real estate taxes, assessment taxes, federal estate\ntaxes, and state inheritance taxes. If the estate's liquid assets are insufficient to\npay all obligations, the court may order the sale of personal or real property to\nsatisfy the obligations.\nThe court must also hear and satisfy legal life estate claims, including those for\ndower, curtesy, homestead, and elective share.

If the decedent died without a valid will, the\nestate passes to lawful heirs according to the state's laws of descent and\ndistribution, or succession. Laws of descent stipulate who inherits and what\nshare they receive, without regard to the desires of the heirs or the intentions of\nthe deceased.\nFor example, John Astor dies intestate, leaving a wife and four children. The\nlaws of descent in his state provide that the surviving spouse receives one-third\nof the estate, and the four children receive equal shares of the remaining two\nthirds.\nIntestate proceeding with no heirs.

The\nstate's statutes of descent and distribution identify heirs and the respective shares\nof the estate they will receive. In the absence of heirs, title transfers to the state\nor county by escheat.\nAbandonment Property that has been abandoned for a statutory period may also escheat to the\nstate or county.\nForeclosure A property owner who fails to fulfill loan obligations or pay taxes may lose an\nestate through foreclosure.\nEminent domain Various government and public entities can transfer private property to the\npublic sphere by the power of eminent domain. The transfer is involuntary, even\nthough the owner receives compensation. For example, a city government wants\nto widen a highway to accommodate growth. The government uses eminent\ndomain to condemn and purchase all properties abutting the thoroughfare in\norder to complete the construction project.\nAdverse possession State laws may allow a real property owner to lose legal title to an adverse\npossessor. An adverse possessor is someone who enters, occupies, and uses\nanother's property without the knowledge or consent of the owner, or with the\nknowledge of an owner who fails to take any action over a statutory period of\ntime.\nTo claim legal title, the adverse possessor must:\n\uf034 be able to show a claim of right or color of title as reason\nfor the possession\n\uf034 have notorious possession, which is possession without\nconcealment\n\uf034 maintain a consistent claim of hostile possession, which is a\nclaim to ownership and possession regardless of the owner's\nclaims or consent\n\uf034 occupy the property continuously for a statutory period of time\n\uf034 in some states, pay taxes\nChapter 6: Transferring and Recording Title 83",

    "text": "A claim of right is based on the adverse possessor's occupying and maintaining\nthe property as if he or she were the legal owner. Color of title results when a\ngrantee has obtained defective title, or received title by defective means, but\noccupies the property as if he or she were the legal owner. A court may hold that\na claim of right or a claim of colored title is a valid reason for the possession.\nNotorious possession and hostile possession give constructive notice to the\npublic, including the legal owner, that a party other than the legal owner is\noccupying and claiming to own the property. It is possible for such notice to\nprevail over notice by recordation as the dominant evidence of legal ownership,\nprovided the possessor has occupied the property continuously for the statutory\nperiod of time.\nIn some states, the possessor must have paid taxes over a prescribed period to\nobtain title. However, if the possessor has paid rent of any kind, the claim of\nownership might be refuted.\nAvoiding adverse possession. An owner can avert the danger of involuntary\nalienation by adverse possession by periodically inspecting the property within\nstatutory deadlines and evicting any trespassers found. The owner may also sue\nto quiet title, which would eliminate the threat of the adverse possessor's claim\nto legal title.\nA property registered in the Torrens system cannot be lost to adverse possession.\nEstoppel Estoppel prevents a person from claiming a right or interest that is inconsistent\nwith the person's previous statements or acts. As a basis for involuntary\nalienation, the doctrine of estoppel can prevent an owner from re-claiming a\nproperty that was transferred under false pretenses. For example, an owner\nconveys a property with a defective title. The grantor is fully aware of the defect\nbut makes no disclosure to the grantee. The grantor later cures the defect and then\nclaims to be the rightful owner of the property on the basis of the effort and\nexpense of clearing the title. Estoppel disallows the grantor's claim because of the\nprior conveyance action. The grantee remains legal owner and benefits from the\ncleared title as well.\nTITLE RECORDS\nChain of title\nRecording system\nTitle evidence\nState laws require the recording of all documents that affect rights and interests\nin real estate in the public real estate records of the county where the property is\nlocated. These public records, or title records, contain a history of every parcel\nof real estate in the county, including names of previous owners, liens,\neasements, and other encumbrances that have been recorded.\n84 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Other public records that affect real estate title are\nmarriage, probate, and tax records.\nGenerally, a County Recorder's Office or other similarly named office maintains\nthe title records.\nTitle records serve a number of purposes, not the least of which is to\navoid ownership disputes. Other important purposes are:\n\uf034 Public notice\nTitle records protect the public by giving all concerned parties\nconstructive notice of the condition of a property's legal title:\nwho owns the property, who maintains claims and\nencumbrances against the property.\n\uf034 Buyer protection\nTitle records protect the buyer by revealing whether a property\nhas marketable title, one free of undesirable encumbrances. The\nbuyer is legally responsible for knowing the condition of title,\nsince it is a matter of public record. Recording a transaction also\nprotects a buyer by replacing the deed as evidence of ownership.\n\uf034 Lienholder protection\nTitle records protect the lienholder by putting the public on notice\nthat the lien exists, and that it may be the basis for a foreclosure\naction. Recording also establishes the lien's priority.\nChain of title Chain of title refers to the succession of property owners of record dating back to\nthe original grant of title from the state to a private party. If there is a missing\nlink in the chronology of owners, or if there was a defective conveyance, the\nchain is said to be broken, resulting in a clouded title to the property. To remove\nthe cloud, an owner may need to initiate a suit to quiet title, which clears the\ntitle record of any unrecorded claims.\nAbstract of Title. An abstract of title is a written, chronological summary of the\nproperty's title records and other public records affecting rights and interests in\nthe property. It includes the property's chain of title and all current recorded liens\nand encumbrances, by date of filing. A title abstractor or title company analyst\nconducts the search of public records, called a title search, needed to produce an\nabstract. Insurers and lenders generally require the search to identify title defects\nand ascertain the current status of encumbrances.\nA title plant is a duplicate set of records of a property copied from public\nrecords and maintained by a private company, such as a title company.\nRecording system There are no federal recording standards.

    "text": "The Torrens system. Certain states and counties use the Torrens system of\nrecording. The Torrens system differs from other title recording systems in that\ntitle passes only when the conveyance has been duly registered on the title\ncertificate itself. Encumbrances likewise have no legal effect until they are\nrecorded. In effect, the Torrens title record is the title itself. It is not necessary to\nsearch public records to ascertain the status of title; it is all reflected on the title\ncertificate.\nTo enter a property in the Torrens system, a court action must first clear title by\ngiving notice to all potential interest holders that they must express their claims.\nAt the end of the proceeding, the court decrees that the title is accepted into\nTorrens registration. The Torrens registry retains the original registration\ndocuments and provides copies to the recorder or other appropriate office. All\nsubsequent transactions affecting title must follow the proper Torrens recording\nprocedures and requirements.\nTitle evidence Marketable title. Since the value of a property is only as good as the\nmarketability of its title, the evidence supporting the status of title is a\nsignificant issue. To demonstrate marketable title to a buyer, a seller must\nshow that the title is free of\n\uf034 doubts about the identity of the current owner\n\uf034 defects, such as an erroneous legal description\n\uf034 claims that could affect value\n\uf034 undisclosed or unacceptable encumbrances\nIn the conventional residential transaction, a buyer's best assurance of\nmarketable title is the title company itself. The title company's due diligence\nin preparing for closing is to investigate the status of the property's title,\ncomplete with liens, claims and encumbrances. This process involves various\nforms of title search and chain-of-title investigation. In essence, if any of\nthese activities uncover title clouds or claims prior to closing, the title\ncompany will stop the closing process until the problem is cleared up.\nThe culmination of the pre-closing title work is obtaining a completed title\ninsurance policy, which in itself is one of the best available assurances of\nclear, marketable title.\nThe four principal forms of evidence in support of the status of marketable title\nare:\n\uf034 a Torrens certificate\n\uf034 a title insurance policy\n\uf034 an attorney's opinion of the title abstract\n\uf034 a title certificate\nTorrens certificate. If available, the Torrens certificate is the best evidence,\nfor the reasons given earlier-- it is not merely a record, but is the title itself.\nTitle insurance. In the absence of Torrens registration, a title insurance policy is\ncommonly accepted as the best evidence of marketable title. A title insurance\npolicy indemnifies the policy holder against losses arising from defects in the\ninsured title.\n86 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Extended coverage protects against liabilities that may not be of public\nrecord, including fraud, unrecorded ownership claims, unintentional recording\nerrors, and unrecorded liens. Extended coverage may also protect against\nadverse possessors, boundary disputes, and prescriptive easements. Neither\nstandard nor extended coverage insures against defects expressly excluded by\nthe policy or defects that the owner might have been aware of but did not\ndisclose.\nBefore issuing a title insurance policy, a title company conducts a title search\nto uncover defects in title or unrecorded breaks in the chain of title. If the\nsearch fails to discover any uninsurable defects, the company issues a binder,\nor commitment to insure. The binder recapitulates the property description,\ninterest to be insured, names of insured parties, and exceptions to coverage.\nAttorney's opinion of abstract. An attorney's opinion of abstract states that\nthe attorney has examined a title abstract, and gives the attorney's opinion of\nthe condition and marketability of the title. Generally, an opinion is not a\nproof or guarantee of clear title. Further, it offers no protection in the event\ntitle turns out to be defective. Also known as opinion of title.\nTitle certificate. A title certificate is a summary of the condition of title as of\nthe date of the certificate, based on a search of public records by an abstractor\nor title analyst. The certificate does not guarantee clear title against defects,\nunrecorded encumbrances or encroachments.\nChapter 6: Transferring and Recording Title 87",
