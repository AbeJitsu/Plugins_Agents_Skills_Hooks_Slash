As a conveyance, a lease\nconveys an interest, called the leasehold estate, but does not convey legal title to\nthe property. For this reason, a leasehold is also called a less-than-freehold\nestate.\nThe four principal types of leasehold estate are:\n\uf034 estate for years: has a specific lease term\n\uf034 estate from period-to-period: the lease term automatically\nrenews\n\uf034 estate at will: has no specified lease term\n\uf034 estate at sufferance: a tenancy without consent\nThe legal essence of a valid lease is that it conveys an exclusive right to use and\noccupy a property for a limited period of time in exchange for rent and the return\nof the property after the lease term is over. Leasehold estates are distinguished\nfrom freeholds by their temporary nature. Every leasehold has a limited duration,\nwhether the term is 99 years or not stated at all, as in an estate at will. While the\nlease conveys exclusive use, it may also restrict such use to conform to the\nlandlord's desires. For example, an apartment lease may prohibit a tenant from\nusing or storing hazardous materials within the premises.\nLike other contracts, a lease becomes a binding agreement when the parties\naccept the terms of the agreement and communicate their agreement to the other\nparty. Recording of a leasehold conveyance is not a requirement for validity,\nalthough it is usually good procedure to do so.\nIn a lease arrangement, the owner is the landlord, or lessor, and the renter is\nthe tenant, or lessee.\n90 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Leasehold rights\nand obligations Tenant's rights and obligations. A lease conveys a leasehold interest or\nestate that grants the tenant the following rights during the lease term:\n\uf034 exclusive possession and occupancy\n\uf034 exclusive use\n\uf034 quiet enjoyment\n\uf034 profits from use\nA tenant has the sole right to occupy and use the premises without interference\nfrom outside parties, including the landlord. The landlord may enter the premises\nfor specified purposes such as inspections, but the interference must be\nreasonable and limited. In addition, the landlord can do nothing outside of the\nlease's express provisions that would impair the tenant's enjoyment of income\nderiving from use of the premises. For example, the landlord can not place a\nkiosk in front of a retail tenant's entry in such a way as to prevent customers\nfrom entering the store.\nThe lease defines the tenant's obligations, which principally are to:\n\uf034 pay the rent on time\n\uf034 maintain the property's condition\n\uf034 comply with the rules and regulations of the building\nLandlord's rights and obligations. In conveying the leasehold estate, the\nlandlord acquires a leased fee estate, which entails the rights to:\n\uf034 receive rent\n\uf034 re-possess the property following the lease term\n\uf034 monitor the tenant's obligations to maintain the premises\nThe lease defines the landlord's obligations, which principally are to:\n\uf034 provide the necessary building support and services\n\uf034 maintain the condition of the property\nDeath of tenant or landlord. A valid lease creates obligations that survive the\ndeath of the landlord or tenant, with certain exceptions. A tenant's estate\nremains liable for payment of rent if the tenant dies; the landlord's estate\nremains bound to provide occupancy despite the landlord's death.\nConveyance of leased property. The landlord may sell, assign, or mortgage\nthe leased fee interest. However, transferring and encumbering the leased\nproperty do not extinguish the obligations and covenants of a lease. Buyers and\ncreditors, therefore, must take their respective interests subject to the terms of\nthe lease.\nContract\nrequirements State contract laws determine the requirements for a valid lease. These\nlaws generally require the following conditions.\nParties. The principal parties must be legally able to enter into the agreement;\ni.e., meet certain age, sanity, and other requirements.\nChapter 7: Leasing Essentials 91",

    "text": "Property description. The lease must identify the property by legal description\nor other locally accepted reference.\nExclusive possession. The landlord must provide an irrevocable right to\nexclusive possession during the lease term, provided the tenant meets all\nobligations.\nLegal and permitted use. The intended use of the property must be legal. A\nuse that is legal but not permitted does not invalidate the lease but constitutes\ngrounds for default.\nConsideration. The lease contract must be accompanied by consideration to the\nlandlord for the rights conveyed. How the consideration is paid does not affect\nthe lease's validity, so long as the parties comply with the terms of the lease.\nOffer and acceptance. The parties must accept the lease, and communicate\ntheir acceptance to the other party, for the lease to take legal effect.\nSignatures. The landlord must sign the lease to convey the leasehold interest. A\ntenant need not sign the lease, although it is prudent to do so in order to enforce\nthe terms of the lease. Multiple tenants who sign a single lease are jointly and\nseverally responsible for fulfilling lease obligations. Thus, if one renter\nabandons an apartment, the other renters remain liable for rent.\nOral versus written form. Generally, a lease for a period exceeding one year\ncannot be oral but must be in writing to be enforceable because of the Statute of\nFrauds. An oral lease or rental agreement is legally construed to be a tenancy at\nwill, having no specified term. Further, an oral lease terminates on the death of\neither principal party.\nLease clauses The clauses of a lease define the contractual relationship between landlord\nand tenant. The most important and basic clauses are the following.\nRent and security deposit. A rent clause stipulates the time, place, manner and\namount of rent payment. It defines any grace period that is allowed, and states\nthe penalties for delinquency.\nThe lease may also call for a security deposit to protect the landlord against\nlosses from property damage or the tenant's default. State law regulates the\nhandling of the security deposit: where it is deposited, and whether the tenant\nreceives interest on the deposit. A landlord may require additional financial\nsecurity from a tenant of dubious creditworthiness in the form of personal\nguarantees, third party guarantees, or pledges of other property as collateral.\nLease term. In the absence of an explicit term with beginning and ending date,\na court will generally construe the lease to be a tenancy at will, cancelable upon\nproper notice.\nRepairs and maintenance. Repairs and maintenance provisions define the\nlandlord's and tenant's respective responsibilities for property repairs and\nmaintenance. Generally, the tenant is responsible for routine maintenance of the\npremises while the landlord is responsible for general repairs. In residential\nleases, the landlord is responsible for major repairs and capital improvements.\nPayment of repairs and maintenance costs, however, is entirely negotiable\nbetween landlord and tenant.\n92 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Subletting and assignment. Subletting (subleasing) is the transfer by a tenant,\nthe sublessor, of a portion of the leasehold interest to another party, the\nsublessee, through the execution of a sublease. The sublease spells out all of the\nrights and obligations of the sublessor and sublessee, including the payment of\nrent to the sublessor. The sublessor remains primarily liable for the original\nlease with the landlord. The subtenant is liable only to the sublessor.\nFor example, a sublessor subleases a portion of the occupied premises for a\nportion of the remaining term. The sublessee pays sublease rent to the sublessor,\nwho in turn pays lease rent to the landlord.\nAn assignment of the lease is a transfer of the entire leasehold interest by a\ntenant, the assignor, to a third party, the assignee. There is no second lease, and\nthe assignor retains no residual rights of occupancy or other leasehold rights\nunless expressly stated in the assignment agreement. The assignee becomes\nprimarily liable for the lease and rent, and the assignor, the original tenant,\nremains secondarily liable. The assignee pays rent directly to the landlord.\nAll leases clarify the rights and restrictions of the tenant regarding subleasing\nand assigning the leasehold interest. Generally, the landlord cannot prohibit\neither act, but the tenant must obtain the landlord's written approval. The reason\nfor this requirement is that the landlord has a financial stake in the\ncreditworthiness of any prospective tenant.\nRules and regulations. A tenant must abide by all usage restrictions imposed\nby the lease's rules and regulations for the property. These rules aim to protect\nthe property's condition as well as the rights of other tenants.\nImprovements and alterations. A landlord typically wants to prevent a tenant\nfrom making alterations that later tenants may not desire. By the same token, a\ntenant who pays for an improvement wants to know who will own it at the end\nof the lease term. An improvements and alterations clause therefore identifies\nnecessary permissions and procedures, and who owns improvements.\nCustomarily, tenant improvements become the property of the landlord in the\nabsence of an express agreement to the contrary.\nOptions. An option clause offers a tenant the opportunity to choose a course of\naction at some time in the future under certain terms. Typical options are the\nright to renew the lease, buy the property, and lease additional adjacent space. A\ntenant does not have to exercise an option, but the landlord must comply if the\ntenant does exercise it.\nDamage and destruction. A damage and destruction provision defines the\nrights and obligations of the parties in the event the leased premises are\ndamaged or destroyed. State laws regulate such provisions.\nChapter 7: Leasing Essentials 93",

    "text": "TYPES OF LEASE\nGross lease\nNet lease\nPercentage lease\nResidential lease\nCommercial lease\nGround lease\nProprietary lease\nLeasing of rights\nGross lease A gross lease, or full service lease, requires the landlord to pay the property's\noperating expenses, including utilities, repairs, and maintenance, while the\ntenant pays only rent. Rent levels under a gross lease are higher than under a\nnet lease, since the landlord recoups expense outlays in the form of added\nrent.\nGross leases are common for office and industrial properties. Residential leases\nare usually gross leases with the exception that the tenants often pay utilities\nexpenses.\nNet lease A net lease requires a tenant to pay for utilities, internal repairs, and a\nproportionate share of taxes, insurance, and operating expenses in addition to\nrent. In effect, the landlord \"passes through\" actual property expenses to the\ntenant rather than charging a higher rent level. Net leases vary as to exactly what\nexpenses the tenant is responsible for. The extreme form of net lease requires\ntenants to cover all expenses, including major repairs and property taxes.\nNet leases are common for office and industrial properties. They are sometimes\nalso used for single family dwellings.\nIn practice, the terms net and gross lease can be misleading: some gross leases\nstill require tenants to pay some expenses such as utilities and repairs. Similarly,\nsome net leases require the landlord to pay certain expenses. Prudent tenants and\nlandlords look at all expense obligations in relation to the level of rent to be\ncharged.\nPercentage lease A percentage lease allows the landlord to share in the income generated from\nthe use of the property. A tenant pays percentage rent, or an amount of rent\nequal to a percentage of the tenant's periodic gross sales. The percentage rent\nmay be:\n\uf034 a fixed percent of gross revenue without a minimum rent\n\uf034 a fixed minimum rent plus an additional percent of gross sales\n\uf034 a percentage rent or minimum rent, whichever is greater\nPercentage leases are used only for retail properties.\nResidential lease A residential lease may be a net lease or a gross lease. Usually, it is a form of\ngross lease in which the landlord pays all property expenses except the\ntenant's utilities and water. Since residential leases tend to be short in term,\ntenants cannot be expected to pay for major repairs and improvements. The\n94 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

As a rule, a commercial lease is a significant and complex\nbusiness proposition. It may involve hundreds of thousands of dollars for\nimproving the property to the tenant's specifications. Since the lease terms are\noften long, total rent liabilities for the tenant can easily be millions of dollars.\nSome important features of commercial leases are:\n\uf034 long term, ranging up to 25 years\n\uf034 require tenant improvements to meet particular usage needs\n\uf034 virtually all lease clauses are negotiable due to the financial\nmagnitude of the transaction\n\uf034 default can have serious financial consequences; therefore,\nlease clauses must express all points of agreement and be\nvery precise\nGround lease A ground lease, or land lease, concerns the land portion of a real property.\nThe owner grants the tenant a leasehold interest in the land only, in exchange\nfor rent.\nGround leases are primarily used in three circumstances:\n\uf034 an owner wishes to lease raw land to an agricultural or mining\ninterest\n\uf034 unimproved property is to be developed and either the owner\nwants to retain ownership of the land, or the developer or future\nusers of the property do not want to own the land\n\uf034 the owner of an improved property wishes to sell an interest in the\nimprovements while retaining ownership of the underlying land\nIn the latter two instances, a ground lease offers owners, developers, and users\nvarious financing, appreciation, and tax advantages. For example, a ground lease\nlessor can take advantage of the increase in value of the land due to the new\nimprovements developed on it, without incurring the risks of developing and\nowning the improvements. Land leases executed for the purpose of development\nor to segregate ownership of land from ownership of improvements are\ninherently long term leases, often ranging from thirty to fifty years.\nProprietary lease A proprietary lease conveys a leasehold interest to an owner of a cooperative.\nThe proprietary lease does not stipulate rent, as the rent is equal to the owner's\nshare of the periodic expenses of the entire cooperative. The term of the lease is\nChapter 7: Leasing Essentials 95",

The rights lease may be very specific, stating how much of a\nmineral or other resource may be extracted, how the rights may be exercised, for\nwhat period of time, and on what portions of the property. The lessee's rights do\nnot include common leasehold interests such as occupancy, exclusion, quiet\nenjoyment, or possession of the leased premises.\nAnother example of a rights lease is where a railroad wants to erect a bridge\nover a thoroughfare owned by a municipality. The railroad must obtain an air\nrights agreement of some kind, whether it be an easement, a purchase, or a\nlease, before it can construct the bridge.\nDEFAULT AND TERMINATION\nRemedies for default\nDefault by tenant\nDefault by landlord\nCauses for lease termination\nRemedies for default A landlord or tenant who violates any of the terms and covenants of the lease\nhas breached the contract and is in default. In the event of a default, the\ndamaged party may pursue court action, including suing for\n\uf034 damages\n\uf034 cancellation of the lease\n\uf034 specific performance\nA successful suit for specific performance compels the defaulting party to\nperform the contract obligation that was breached. For example, if a landlord fails\nto replace carpeting as promised in the lease, the tenant can sue to obtain the\nlandlord's specific performance of installing a new carpet.\nDefault by tenant Tenant default occurs most commonly from failure to pay rent or maintain the\npremises. If a tenant is in default, the landlord may file a suit for possession,\nalso called a suit for eviction. If successful in this suit, the landlord can\nrepossess the property and evict the tenant. The landlord also has the right to\nsue for damages.\nBefore filing a suit for possession, the landlord must give the tenant proper\nnotice to pay monies due or otherwise cure the default before a deadline, or else\nvacate the premises. If the deadline passes without satisfaction, the landlord may\n96 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "file the suit and obtain a judgment for possession. The landlord may then obtain\nan order directing the sheriff to complete the eviction, forcibly if necessary.\nDefault by landlord The most common form of landlord default is failure to provide services and\nmaintain the property condition. When a landlord defaults on the terms of the\nlease, tenants may sue for damages. In an instance where the landlord's\nnegligence or disruptive action has rendered the property unoccupiable, a tenant\nmay vacate the premises and declare that the lease is cancelled by default. This\naction, called constructive eviction, can nullify the tenant's lease obligations if\nthe claim succeeds in court. In order to obtain a constructive eviction judgment,\nthe tenant must vacate the premises.\nFor example, a landlord will not repair a roof and will not allow an office\ntenant to make the repair and deduct the cost from the rent. A thunderstorm\nsoaks the suite and ruins several pieces of office equipment. By refusing to act,\nthe landlord has breached the lease covenant to maintain the premises. The\ntenant moves out, claiming the lease null and void. The tenant also sues the\nlandlord for damages to the equipment and for recovery of relocation expenses.\nCauses for lease\ntermination A lease may terminate for any of the following causes.\nBreach or default. Breach of contract or default, as previously discussed,\nmay terminate a lease.\nTerm expiration. In a tenancy for years, the lease automatically terminates\nat the end of the lease term.\nNotice. Proper notice by either party may terminate a periodic leasehold, or\na tenancy at will.\nVoluntary agreement. Both parties can agree to terminate a lease at any\ntime.\nProperty destruction. Destruction of the property is grounds for\nterminating lease obligations.\nCondemnation. A taking by eminent domain proceedings generally\nterminates a lease.\nForeclosure. A foreclosure extinguishes all prior interests in a property,\nincluding a leasehold.\nDeath of tenant or landlord, with qualifications. A lease for tenancy at\nwill terminates on the death of either landlord or tenant. A lease also\nterminates on the death of the landlord if the landlord held a life estate\ninterest in the property, since the landlord could not have conveyed an\ninterest that extended beyond his or her own interest.\nExcept in the circumstances mentioned, a lease does not terminate on the\ndeath of the landlord or tenant. Sale of the property also does not terminate a\nlease.\nAbandonment. If a tenant abandons a leased property and demonstrates no\nintention of fulfilling the obligations of the lease, the landlord may re-take\npossession and pursue legal recourses for default. In such a case, the tenant\nremains liable for payment of rent. The landlord also has the option of\nterminating the lease, which releases the tenant from responsibility for rent.\nChapter 7: Leasing Essentials 97",

Numerous states have\nenacted tenant-landlord regulations in response to the law.\nThe act aims to:\n\uf034 equalize and standardize rights of landlord and tenant\n\uf034 protect tenants from unethical practices\n\uf034 prevent unfair, complex leases and their enforceability\nOne important effect of URLTA is that it prompted legislation at the state level\nthat empowered the courts to nullify residential leases that violated URLTA\nguidelines, particularly where a lease gave unfair advantage to the landlord.\nAreas of regulation URLTA legislation primarily addresses the lease contract, deposits and\nadvances, obligations of landlord and tenant, the landlord's rights of access,\nand standards for eviction.\nLease agreements. URLTA sets standards for improving oral,\nvague, or unbalanced lease agreements. The law's positions on these\nissues are:\n\uf034 unclear lease term: becomes a periodic tenancy\n\uf034 rent amount: fair market value or court's opinion\n\uf034 waiving of rights: certain rights cannot be waived\nThe law intends to avoid irregularities and vagueness in the lease term and rent\nobligations, as these can cause exaggeration in a landlord's claim for the\namount of rent due from a defaulting tenant. A vague lease term can also lead\nto a dispute about the duration of a tenant's possession rights. A landlord, for\nexample, could claim that a lease has expired in order to acquire a higher-\npaying tenant. URLTA also discourages the landlord practice of persuading\ntenants to waive rights they do not understand or are unaware of.\nDeposit and advance. URLTA requires leases to be clear about:\n\uf034 maximum deposit amount\n\uf034 the tenant's right to earn interest on the deposit\n98 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Under URLTA, a landlord must:\n\uf034 bargain in good faith with the tenant\n\uf034 provide required maintenance\n\uf034 make repairs\n\uf034 comply with local building codes\n\uf034 provide access and safety services: elevator; fire escapes, etc.\n\uf034 provide a procedure for delivery of official notices\nTenant's obligations. A tenant must:\n\uf034 bargain in good faith\n\uf034 maintain the condition of the leased premises\n\uf034 abide by (legitimate) rules and regulations of the building\n\uf034 refrain from abusing or causing destruction to the property\n\uf034 limit uses to those approved\n\uf034 avoid unduly disturbing other tenants\nAccess. URLTA attempts to balance the landlord's right to access the premises\nwith the tenant's right of quiet enjoyment. The landlord has the right to enter the\npremises at any time when acting to prevent damage or destruction; to make\nrepairs or show the property, on giving proper notice; if the purpose is not\narbitrary and the time is reasonable The tenant may not refuse the landlord entry\nfor acceptable reasons such as emergencies, repairs, inspections, and showings.\nDefault and eviction. URLTA attempts to establish equitable procedures for\ndealing with lease defaults. If the landlord defaults, a tenant may sue for\ndamages, terminate the agreement, or negotiate a rent abatement. Tenants\ngenerally are not released of liability for rent during a dispute. Rents, however,\nmay be paid to a court impound pending judgment. If a tenant defaults, the\nlandlord may terminate and evict, provided proper notice is made and the\nlandlord can justify the cause for the action.\nExemptions. State laws based on URLTA generally do not apply to transient\noccupancies, such as hotel and motel rentals, proprietary leases in cooperatives,\nor to occupancy in a residence that is under a contract for deed.\nChapter 7: Leasing Essentials 99",
