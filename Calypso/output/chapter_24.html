Calculating area To find the area of an irregular shape, try dividing it into triangles, rectangles, squares or trapezoids and calculate the areas of those parts; the area of the whole shape is then the sum of the areas of all of its subparts. Base and height 1. Formulas for area of three- and four-sided shapes use a product of base and height. In the formulas, a represents area, b represents base, h represents height, SF represents square feet. 2. The base of a triangle, square, or rectangle may be any side; a trapezoid has two bases, its two parallel sides. 3. The height of a triangle is the length of a perpendicular line from the base to the triangle&#x27;s opposite point. Height in a square, rectangle or trapezoid is the length of a line which is perpendicular to the base line(s). 404 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama</p>

After all, the assets only totaled $352,000. What was the price? Sales contracts (Chapter 14) &quot;Percentage of listing price&quot; calculation 1. Formula: Percentage of listing price = offer divided by listing price 2. Example: A property listed for $400,000 receives an offer for $360,000. The percentage of listing price is: $360,000 divided by 400,000 = 90% Problem 12: A seller receives an offer of $674,000 on a property listed at $749,000. How much is the offer as a percent of the listing price? Earnest money deposit calculation 1. Formula: Deposit = Listing price x required percentage 2.

For comparable A, the estimator has made three adjustments -- for the number of bedrooms and baths, and for gross living area -- totaling $50,000, or 5.9% of the purchase price. For comparable B, the estimator has deducted values for age, lot, condition, bedrooms, and baths. The total of five adjustments amounts to $70,000, or 7.4% of the sale price. For comparable C, the estimator has adjusted only for the age. The adjustment of $20,000, 2% of sale price, raises the indicated value of the subject to $1,020,000. For comparable D, a deduction has been made for the comparable’s superior location. This is offset by additions for the number of bedrooms and gross living area reflecting where the comparable is inferior to the subject. The three adjustments amount to a total of +$50,000, or 4.6% of the sale price. 414 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama</p>
<div class='page-break'></div>
<p class='paragraph'>Weighting the indicated values of the comparables, the estimator has developed an indicated value of $1,000,000 for the subject. Underlying this conclusion is the fact that Comparable C is by far the best indicator of value, and therefore receives the heaviest weighting as a value indicator. This property has the fewest adjustments (1) and smallest total adjustment amount (2%). Comparable D might be the second-best indicator, since it has the second-lowest number of adjustments (3), and the net adjustment is also second-best as a percent of the sale price (4.6%). Comparable A might be the third best indicator, since it has the second smallest number of total adjustments (3) but the second highest net adjustment percent (5.9%). Comparable B has the greatest number of adjustments (5) and the highest percent of sale price (7.4%) and is therefore the least reliable indicator. Income capitalization Gross rent multiplier (GRM) 1. Formula: gross rent x multiplier = value 2. Example: $2,000 x 135 GRM = $270,000 Gross income multiplier (GIM) 1. Formula: gross annual income x GIM = value 2. Example: $45,000 x 9 GIM = $405,000 Net income capitalization 1. Formula: annual net operating income (NOI) ÷ capitalization rate = value 2. Example: $50,000 ÷ .10 = $500,000 Problem 17: An apartment building grosses $450,000 annually, nets 350,000, and has a capitalization rate of 9%. Prevailing GIMs are 8.

(1) improvements-to-land ratio = 3:1, or 75% (2) improvement value = $400,000 x 75% = $300,000 (3) annual depreciation = $300,000 ÷ 39 = $7,692 Problem 27: A property is purchased for $400,000. Improvements account for 80% of the value. Given a 39-year depreciation term, what is the annual depreciation expense? Chapter 24: Real Estate Math 421</p>
