The parties to the relationship are\nthe principal (a client), the agent (a broker), and the customer ( a third\nparty).\nThe laws of agency are distinct from laws of contracts, although the two\ngroups of laws interact with each other. For example, the listing agreement -- a\ncontract -establishes an agency relationship. Thus the relationship is subject to\ncontract law. However, agency law dictates how the relationship will achieve\nits purposes, regardless of what the listing contract states.\nThe essence of the agency relationship is trust, confidence, and mutual good\nfaith. The principal trusts the agent to exercise the utmost skill and care in\nfulfilling the authorized activity, and to promote the principal's best interests.\nThe agent undertakes to strive in good faith to achieve the desired objective,\nand to fulfill the fiduciary duties.\nIt is important to understand that the agency relationship does not require\ncompensation or any form of consideration. Nor does compensation define\nan agency relationship: a party other than the principal may compensate\nthe agent.\nBasic roles In an agency relationship, a principal hires an agent as a fiduciary to perform a\ndesired service on the principal's behalf. As a fiduciary, the agent has a legal\nobligation to fulfill specific fiduciary duties throughout the term of the\nrelationship.\n142 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "The principal, or client, is the party who hires the agent. The agent works for\nthe client. The principal may be a seller, a buyer, a landlord, or a tenant.\nThe agent is the fiduciary of the principal, hired to perform the authorized\nwork and bound to fulfill fiduciary duties. In real estate brokerage the agent\nmust be a licensed broker.\nThe customer or prospect is a third party in the transaction whom the agent does\nnot represent. The agent works with a customer in fulfilling the client's\nobjectives. A seller, buyer, landlord, or tenant may be a customer. A third party\nwho is a potential customer is a prospect.\nTypes of agency According to the level of authority delegated to the agent, there are three types of\nagency: universal, general, and special.\nUniversal agency. In a universal agency relationship, the principal empowers the\nagent to perform any and all actions that may be legally delegated to an agency\nrepresentative. The instrument of authorization is the power of attorney.\nGeneral agency. In a general agency, the principal delegates to the agent\nongoing tasks and duties within a particular business or enterprise. Such\ndelegation may include the authority to enter into contracts.\nSpecial, or limited, agency. Under a special agency agreement, the principal\ndelegates authority to conduct a specific activity, after which the agency\nrelationship terminates. In most cases, the special agent may not bind the\nprincipal to a contract.\nIn most instances, real estate brokerage is based on a special agency. The\nprincipal hires a licensed broker to procure a ready, willing, and able buyer or\nseller. When the objective is achieved, the relationship terminates, although\ncertain fiduciary duties survive the relationship.\nCreating an\nagency relationship An agency relationship may arise from an express oral or written agreement\nbetween the principal and the agent, or from the actions of the parties by\nimplication.\nWritten or oral listing agreement. The most common way of creating an\nagency relationship is by listing agreement, which may be oral or written. The\nagreement sets forth the various authorizations and duties, as well as\nrequirements for compensation. A listing agreement establishes an agency for a\nspecified transaction and has a stated expiration.\nImplied agency. An agency relationship can arise by implication, intentionally or\nunintentionally. Implication means that the parties act as if there were an\nagreement. For example, if an agent promises a buyer to do everything possible\nto find a property at the lowest possible price, and the buyer accepts the\nproposition, there may be an implied agency relationship even though there is no\nspecific agreement. Even if the agent does not wish to establish an agency\nrelationship, the agent's actions may be construed to imply a relationship.\nChapter 11 National Agency 143",

If these are not\nfulfilled, the agent may be held liable\nTerminating an\nagency relationship Full performance of all obligations by the parties terminates an agency\nrelationship. In addition, the parties may terminate the relationship at any time\nby mutual agreement. Thirdly, the agency relationship automatically\nterminates on the expiration date, whether the obligations were performed or\nnot.\nInvoluntary termination. An agency relationship may terminate contrary to\nthe wishes of the parties by reason of:\n\uf034 death or incapacity of either party\n\uf034 abandonment by the agent\n\uf034 condemnation or destruction of the property\n\uf034 renunciation\n\uf034 breach\n\uf034 bankruptcy\n\uf034 revocation of the agent's license\nInvoluntary termination of the relationship may create legal and financial\nliability for a party who defaults or cancels. For example, a client may\nrenounce an agreement but then be held liable for the agent's expenses or\ncommission.\nFIDUCIARY DUTIES\nAgent's duties to the client\nAgent's duties to the customer\nPrincipal's duties\nBreach of duty\nThe agency relationship imposes fiduciary duties on the client and agent, but\nparticularly on the agent. An agent must also observe certain standards of\nconduct in dealing with customers and other outside parties.\nAgent's duties\nto the client Skill, care, and diligence. The agent is hired to do a job, and is therefore\nexpected to do it with diligence and reasonable competence. Competence is\ngenerally defined as a level of real estate marketing skills and knowledge\ncomparable to those of other practitioners in the area.\nThe notion of care extends to observing the limited scope of authority granted\nto the agent. A conventional listing agreement does not authorize an agent to\nobligate the client to contracts, and it does not allow the agent to conceal\noffers to buy, sell, or lease coming from a customer or another agent. Further,\nsince a client relies on a broker's representations, a broker must exercise care\nnot to offer advice outside of his or her field of expertise. Violations of this\nstandard may expose the agent to liability for the unlicensed practice of a\nprofession such as law, engineering, or accounting.\n144 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

An agent has the duty to inform the client of all material facts,\nreports, and rumors that might affect the client's interests in the property\ntransaction.\nIn recent years, the disclosure standard has been raised to require an agent to\ndisclose items that a practicing agent should know, whether the agent actually\nhad the knowledge or not, and regardless of whether the disclosure furthers or\nimpedes the progress of the transaction.\nThe most obvious example of a \"should have known\" disclosure is a property\ndefect, such as an inoperative central air conditioner, that the agent failed to\nnotice. If the air conditioner becomes a problem, the agent may be held liable for\nfailing to disclose a material fact if a court rules that the typical agent in that area\nwould detect and recognize a faulty air conditioner.\nThere is no obligation to obtain or disclose information related to a customer's\nrace, creed, color, religion, sex or national origin: anti-discrimination laws hold\nsuch information to be immaterial to the transaction.\nSome states have recently enacted laws requiring a seller to make a written\ndisclosure about property condition to a prospective buyer.

    "text": "Agent's duties\nto the customer The traditional notion of caveat emptor-- let the buyer beware-- no longer applies\nunequivocally to real estate transactions. Agents do have certain obligations to\ncustomers, even though they do not represent them. In general, they owe a third\nparty:\n\uf034 honesty and fair dealing\n\uf034 reasonable care and skill\n\uf034 proper disclosure\nAn agent has a duty to deal fairly and honestly with a customer. Thus, an agent\nmay not deceive, defraud, or otherwise take advantage of a customer.\n\"Reasonable care and skill\" means that an agent will be held to the standards of\nknowledge, expertise, and ethics that are commonly maintained by other agents\nin the area.\nProper disclosure primarily concerns disclosure of agency, property condition,\nand environmental hazards.\nAn agent who fails to live up to prevailing standards may be held liable for\nnegligence, fraud, or violation of state real estate license laws and regulations.\nAgents should be particularly careful about misrepresenting and offering\ninappropriate expert advice when working with customers.\nIntentional misrepresentation. An agent may intentionally or unintentionally\ndefraud a buyer by misrepresenting or concealing facts. While it is acceptable to\npromote the features of a property to a buyer or the virtues of a buyer to a seller,\nit is a fine line that divides promotion from misrepresentation. Silent\nmisrepresentation, which is intentionally failing to reveal a material fact, is just as\nfraudulent as a false statement.\nNegligent misrepresentation. An agent can be held liable for failure to disclose\nfacts the agent was not aware of if it can be demonstrated that the agent should\nhave known such facts. For example, if it is a common standard that agents\ninspect property, then an agent can be held liable for failing to disclose a leaky\nroof that was not inspected.\nMisrepresentation of expertise. An agent should not act or speak outside the\nagent's area of expertise. A customer may rely on anything an agent says, and the\nagent will be held accountable. For example, an agent represents that a property\nwill appreciate. The buyer interprets this as expert investment advice and buys\nthe property. If the property does not appreciate, the buyer may hold the agent\nliable.\nPrincipal's\nduties The obligations of a principal in an agency relationship concern the following:\nAvailability. In a special agency, the power and decision-making authority of the\nagent are limited. Therefore, the principal must be available for consultation,\ndirection, and decision-making. Otherwise the agent cannot complete the job.\nChapter 11 National Agency 147",

If an agreement includes a provision for compensating the agent\nand the agent performs in accordance with the agreement, the client is obligated\nto compensate the agent. As indicated earlier, however, the agency relationship\ndoes not necessarily include compensation.\nBreach of duty An agent is liable for a breach of duty to client or customer. Since clients and\ncustomers rely on the expertise and actions of agents performing within the\nscope of their authority, regulatory agencies and courts aggressively enforce\nagency laws, standards, and regulations.\nA breach of duty may result in:\n\uf034 rescission of the listing agreement (causing a loss of a\npotential commission)\n\uf034 forfeiture of any compensation that may have already been earned\n\uf034 disciplinary action by state license law authorities, including\nlicense suspension or revocation\n\uf034 suit for damages in court\nFORMS OF REAL ESTATE AGENCY\nSingle agency\nSubagency\nDual agency\nDesignated agency\nNo agency\nNo subagency\nThe primary forms of agency relationship between brokers and principals are:\nsingle agency, dual agency, and subagency.

The client may be either seller or\nbuyer.\nSeller agency. In the traditional situation, a seller or landlord is the agent's client.\nA buyer or tenant is the customer.\nBuyer agency. Recently, it has become common for an agent to represent a\nbuyer or tenant. In this relationship, the property buyer or tenant is the client and\nthe property owner is the customer.\nReal estate vernacular calls an agent of the seller or owner the listing broker. An\nagent who works for the listing broker and who obtained the listing is the listing\nagent. A broker who represents a buyer is the buyer's broker. One who does\nthis as a specialization is a buyer broker. A broker or salesperson who\nrepresents tenants is a tenant representative.\nSubagency In a subagency, a broker or licensed salesperson works as the agent of a broker\nwho is the agent of a client. Subagents might include a cooperating licensed\nbroker, that broker's licensed salespeople, and the listing broker's licensed\nsalespeople, all of whom agree to work for the listing broker on behalf of the\nclient. In effect, a subagent is an agent of the broker who is agent of the client.\nThe subagent owes the same duties to the agent as the agent owes to the client.\nBy extension, a subagent owes all the fiduciary duties to the client.\nOutside \"co-brokers\" and agents. It is common practice for brokers and\nsalespersons to \"cooperate\" with a listing broker in finding buyers or tenants. A\nlisting broker, in return, agrees to share the commission with a cooperating broker.\nChapter 11 National Agency 149",

All of the listing broker's salespeople who have\nagreed to work for the broker to find a customer are subagents of the listing\nbroker and owe the fiduciary duties to the broker and, by extension, to the\nbroker's client.\nDual agency Dual agency means representing both principal parties to a transaction. The agent\nrepresents both buyer and seller or tenant and owner. For instance, if a\nsalesperson completes a buyer agency agreement with a party on behalf of a\nbroker, and the party then becomes interested in a property listed by the broker,\nthe broker becomes a dual agent.\nDual agency has become increasingly prevalent with the advent of buyer and\ntenant representation. Dual agency may arise from voluntary, specific agreement\nbetween the principal parties or from the parties' actions, much like implied\nsingle agency.\nConflict of interest. Dual agency contains an inherent conflict of interest.\nSince many of an agent's fiduciary duties can only be rendered to one party,\ndual agency is, by definition, difficult, if not impossible.\nWritten, informed consent. In states that permit dual agency, the agent must\nmeet strict disclosure requirements, and principals must agree in writing to\nproceed with the dual agency relationship.\nDisclosed (voluntary) dual agency. The parties to a transaction may create a\ndual agency by giving written consent in disclosure forms, confirmation forms,\nand sale contract forms. For example, an agent represents a buyer who becomes\ninterested in a property that the agent has listed with the seller. The agent then\ndiscloses the relationship with the principals to both principals, and the principals\nagree in writing to move ahead. A disclosed dual agency is thus voluntarily\ncreated.\nImplied and undisclosed dual agency. If a broker or agent acts in any way\nthat leads a customer to believe that the agent is representing the customer, a\ndual agency has potentially been created. For example, a buyer makes\nconfidential disclosures to the agent who works for the seller and exhorts the\nagent to keep them confidential. The buyer wants the house but knows he is\ngoing to lose his job in a month and probably will not qualify for financing. If\nthe agent agrees to keep the information confidential, the agent has not only\ncreated an agency relationship with the buyer, but is now in a dual agency\nsituation. Moreover, if the agent fails to disclose the buyer's confidence to the\nseller, the agent has violated fiduciary duty to the seller.\nDuties of a disclosed dual agent. A dual agent's first duty is to disclose the\nagency relationship to both principal parties or to withdraw from one side of the\nduality. After disclosing, the agent must obtain the written consent of both\nparties.\n150 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

The designated agency\nagreement allows a broker to select a salesperson and associate brokers to act as\nthe client\u2019s agent.\nA designated agency agreement must contain the name of all associate brokers\nwho are authorized to act as supervisory brokers.

A designated agent cannot disclose a client\u2019s confidential information to\nany licensee, whether or not an affiliated licensee, except that a designated agent\nmay disclose to any supervisory broker confidential information of a client for\npurposes of seeking advice or assistance for the benefit of the client.
