With any investment, one wants the\noriginal investment to grow, without losing it. This idea is called conservation of\ncapital. Unfortunately, no investment is truly secure. External conditions change,\nand the investment itself can change. Even if you do nothing with it, its value\ndoes not remain constant.\nRisk versus return. The general rule in investments is that the safer the\ninvestment, the more slowly it gains in value. The more you want it to gain, and\nthe more quickly, the more you must risk losing it. How much do you want to\nearn, and how much are you willing to risk to earn it? Reward in investing\ncorresponds directly to the degree of risk.\nManagement. Another aspect of investment is the amount of attention you must\npay to it to make it work. You can deposit cash in a passbook account and forget\nabout it. You can use your cash to buy a business and then run the business\nyourself to make your asset grow and earn. How much do you want to be\ninvolved in managing your investment?\nLiquidity. The issue of exchangeability is an important one in investment. How\neasy is it to recover your invested resource, without loss, and exchange it for\nanother one that you want? If there is a market for the type of resource you have-\nother people want to buy and sell it for themselves-- your investment is liquid.\nThe most liquid form of financial investment is generally cash, since cash is itself\na medium of exchange and people always want it. A more illiquid investment is\none which takes a long time to exchange for something you prefer to own. How\nlong are you willing to wait to recover your invested resource and its earnings?\nChapter 18: Real Estate Investment 281",

    "text": "Rewards The basic aim of financial investment is to increase one's wealth, to add value to\nwhat you have. This can occur in several ways.\nIncome. An investment can generate income in some way on a periodic basis.\nYou may consume this cash, spending it for goods and services that, when used\nup, have no further value. Or, you may use the cash to put into another\ninvestment.\nAppreciation. Your invested asset itself may gain value over time because of an\nincrease in market demand for it. When you sell or exchange it for something\nelse you prefer to have, you get more than you originally put into the investment.\nLeverage. You may pledge the value of your resource to borrow funds in order\nto make an investment that is larger than your own resource permits you to do\ndirectly. The small resource is used as a lever to make a larger investment, and\nthus increases your opportunity to benefit from income, appreciation, and the\nother rewards of investment.\nTax benefits. Some investments receive treatment under tax laws that enables the\ninvestor to reduce or defer the amount of tax owed. Tax dollars you don't have to\npay are dollars you have available for some other use, such as consuming or\nfurther investing.\nRisks Investment risks come from a variety of general sources, including the market,\nbusiness operations, the value of money, and changes in the interest rate.\nMarket risk. Changes in the demand for your invested resource may cause your\ninvestment to lose value and to become illiquid.\nBusiness risk. Changes in the operation of a business with which your\ninvestment is connected may reduce or eliminate the income- and appreciation-\nearning capacity of your investment.\nPurchasing power risk. Changes in the value of money as an exchange medium,\nsuch as through inflation, may decrease the practical value of your invested\nresource.\nFinancial risk. Changes in financial markets, particularly in interest rates, may\nreduce the value of your investment by making it less desirable to others and by\nmaking it more expensive for you to maintain.\nAn investment may fail to produce any or all of the desired investment rewards\nlisted earlier. The expected income may not be realized. The invested asset may\nfail to appreciate as expected. It may even decline in value. Perhaps even worse,\nyou may be called on to add to the investment just to keep it in place. Your\nleverage may turn against you, becoming negative leverage. This is the situation\nwhen your cost of borrowing funds to make the investment becomes greater than\nthe income the investment returns to you. Finally, your expectation of a tax\nadvantage may be disappointed. Tax laws are constantly changing.\n282 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Types of\ninvestments Four of the most important types of investment are investments in money, equity,\ndebt, and real estate.\nMoney investments. A money investment is one in which the basic form of the\ninvestment remains money. Examples are: deposit accounts, certificates of\ndeposit, money funds, and annuities. The basic reward from a money investment\ncomes in the form of interest. Money investments are relatively safe, with\ncorrespondingly conservative rates of return.\nDebt investments. A debt investment is one in which an investor buys a debt\ninstrument. Examples are bonds, notes, mortgages, and bond mutual funds. The\nbasic reward comes in the form of interest. Debt investments are usually riskier\nthan money investments and less risky than stocks or real estate.\nEquity investments. An equity investment is one in which an investor buys an\nownership interest in a business concern. Examples are stocks and stock mutual\nfunds. The basic rewards come in the form of dividends and appreciation of share\nvalue. Equity investments are generally riskier than money and debt investments.\nReal estate investments. A real estate investment is one in which an investor\nbuys real estate for its investment benefits rather than primarily for its utility. It\nmay have the features of both an equity and debt investment, depending on the\ntype of real estate involved and numerous other factors, such as the type of\ninterest one owns. A real estate investor may invest in an income-producing\nproperty or a non-income producing property.\n\uf034 Non-income property\na residential property used as the investor's primary residence.\nThe basic reward, beyond the enjoyment of use, comes in the\nform of appreciation. There may also be tax benefits, depending\non how the purchase is financed.\n\uf034 Income property\na property owned specifically for the investment rewards it\noffers. Examples are multi-family residential properties, retail\nstores, industrial properties, and office buildings. Rewards come\nin any or all of the forms mentioned earlier: income,\nappreciation, leverage and tax advantages.\nChapter 18: Real Estate Investment 283",

    "text": "REAL ESTATE AS AN INVESTMENT\nRisk and reward\nIlliquidity\nManagement requirements\nReal estate investments participate in the general risks and rewards of all\ninvestments. However, real estate investments are often complex. They are also\ndistinguished by their lack of liquidity and by the amount of management they\nrequire. In addition, each investor has specific aims and circumstances that affect\nthe viability of any particular real estate investment for that individual. Licensees\nwho lack expertise in the area of real estate investment analysis should refer\npotential investors to a competent advisor. Nevertheless, a licensee should be\nfamiliar with the basics of real estate as an investment.\nRisk and reward Capital put into real estate is always subject to the full range of risk factors:\nmarket changes, income shortfalls, negative leverage, tax law changes, and poor\noverall return.\nMarket demand for a specific type of property can decline. For example, a\nbusiness district's retailers may vacate stores in an area in order to obtain better\nspace in a new shopping center. Market downturns leave the income property\ninvestor with an unmarketable property or one which can only be re-leased at a\nloss of some portion of the original investment. Thus the expected reward from\nincome or appreciation may never be obtained.\nAnother risk of the investment property is the cost of development or operation.\nIf start-up costs or ongoing operating costs exceed rental income, the owner must\ndip into additional capital resources to maintain the investment until its income\nincreases. If income does not rise, or if costs do not decline, the investor can\nsimply run out of money.\nLeverage is a constant risk in real estate investment. If the property fails to\ngenerate sufficient revenue, the costs of borrowed money can bankrupt the\nowner, just as development and operating costs can. Investors often overlook the\nfact that leverage only works when the yield on the investment exceeds the costs\nof borrowed funds.\nTax law is an ongoing risk in long-term real estate investment. If the investor's\ntax circumstances change, or if the tax laws do, the investor may end up paying\nmore capital gains and income taxes than planned, undermining the return on the\ninvestment. An investor needs to consider carefully the value of such potential\ntax benefits as deductions for mortgage interest, tax losses, deferred gains,\nexemptions, and tax credits for certain types of real estate investment.\nAnother consideration is opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is the return that an\ninvestor could earn on capital invested with minimal risk. If the real estate\ninvestment, with all its attendant risk, cannot yield a greater return than an\n284 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "investment elsewhere involving less risk, then the opportunity cost is too high for\nthe real estate investment. Despite all the risks, real estate remains a popular\ninvestment, because, historically, the rewards have outweighed the risks. Real\nestate has proven to be relatively resistant to adverse inflationary trends that have\nhurt money, debt, and stock investments. In addition, real estate has proven to be\na viable investment in view of the economy's continued expansion over the last\nfifty years.\nIlliquidity Compared with other classes of investment, real estate is relatively illiquid. Even\nin the case of liquidating a single-family residence, one can expect a marketing\nperiod of at least several months in most markets. In addition, it takes time for the\nbuyer to obtain financing and to complete all the other phases of closing the\ntransaction. Commercial and investment properties can take much longer,\ndepending on market conditions, leases, construction, permitting, and a host of\nother factors. The investor who is in a hurry to dispose of such an investment can\nexpect to receive a lower sales price than may be ideal. Compare this with the\nease of drawing money out of a bank account or selling a stock.\nManagement\nrequirements Real estate tends to require a high degree of investor involvement in management\nof the investment. Even raw land requires some degree of maintenance to\npreserve its value: drainage, fencing, payment of taxes, and periodic inspection,\nto name a few tasks. Improved properties often require extensive management,\nincluding repairs, maintenance, onsite leasing, tenant relations, security, and\nfiscal management.\nREAL ESTATE INVESTMENT ENTITIES\nDirect\nSyndicate and partnership\nReal Estate Investment Trust\nReal Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit\nDirect Individuals, corporations or other investor entities may invest as active investors\nin a property by buying it directly and taking responsibility for managing and\noperating the property.\nSyndicate and\npartnership A real estate syndicate is a group of investors who combine resources to buy,\ndevelop, and/or operate a property.\nA general partnership is a syndicate in which all members participate equally\nin managing the investment and in the profits or losses it generates. The group\ndesignates a trustee to hold title in the name of the syndicate.\nA limited partnership is a syndicate in which a general partner organizes,\noperates and is generally responsible for the partnership's interests in the property.\nLimited partners invest money in the partnership but do not participate in\noperating the property. These limited partners are passive investors.\nChapter 18: Real Estate Investment 285",

    "text": "Real Estate\nInvestment Trust\n(REIT) In a Real Estate Investment Trust, investors buy certificates in the trust, and the\ntrust in turn invests in mortgages or real estate. Investors receive income\naccording to the number of shares they own. A trust must receive at least 75% of\nits income from real estate to qualify as a REIT, and if certain other conditions\nare met, the trust does not have to pay any corporate income tax.\nReal Estate Mortgage\nInvestment Conduit\n(REMIC) A REMIC is a kind of partnership entity formed to hold a fixed pool of\nmortgages that are secured by real property. The entity issues two kinds of\ninterest. Holders of residual interests are treated, for tax purposes, as partners.\nHolders of regular interests are regarded as owning debt instruments. Income (or\nloss) received by regular or residual interest holders is treated as portfolio\nincome or loss, and is not included in determining losses from passive activities.\nTAXATION OF REAL ESTATE\nINVESTMENTS\nTaxable income\nCost recovery\nGain on sale\nInterest\nPassive activities\nReal estate investments are taxed on the income they produce and on the increase\nin value, or gain, when the investment is sold. These forms of taxation are\ndistinct from the ad valorem taxation of real estate.\nTaxable Income Taxable income from investment real estate is the gross income received minus\nany expenses, deductions or exclusions that current tax law allows. Taxable\nincome from real estate is added to the investor's other income and taxed at the\ninvestor's marginal tax rate. The \"Investment Analysis of an Income Property\"\nsection below gives details.\nCost recovery Cost recovery, or depreciation, allows the owner of income property to deduct a\nportion of the property's value from gross income each year over the life of the\nasset. The \"life of the asset\" and the deductible portion are defined by law. In\ntheory, the owner recovers the full cost of the investment if it is held to the end of\nthe asset's economic life as defined by the Internal Revenue Service. At the time\nof selling the asset, the accumulated cost recovery is subtracted from the\ninvestment's original value as part of determining the taxable capital gain.\nCost recovery is allowed only for income properties and that portion of a non-\nincome property which is used to produce income. It applies only to\nimprovements. Land cannot be depreciated. The part of a property which can be\ndepreciated is called the depreciable basis.\n286 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "Depreciation schedules. Residential rental properties are depreciated over a\nperiod of 27.5 years. The basic annual deduction for such property is 3.636%,\nwith adjustments for the month of the taxable year in which the property was\nplaced in service. Non-residential income properties placed in service after 1994\nare depreciated over a period of 39 years (basic annual percentage is 2.564%).\nThe proper method of depreciation should be determined in consultation with a\nqualified tax advisor.\nGain on sale When real estate, whether non-income or income, is sold, a taxable event occurs.\nIf the sale proceeds exceed the original cost of the investment, subject to some\nadjustments, there is a capital gain that is subject to tax. If the sales proceeds are\nless than the original cost with adjustments, there is a capital loss.\n1031 (Starker) exchange. An investor can sometimes defer the reporting of gain\nor loss, and, hence, taxation of gain, by participating in an exchange of like-kind\nassets. The legislation that deals with like-kind exchanges is contained in Section\n1031 of the IRS code. These tax-deferred exchanges are sometimes called Section\n1031 exchanges and Starker exchanges, named for an investor who won a case\nagainst the IRS.\nTo qualify under Section 1031, there must have been a legitimate exchange of the\nassets involved. The property being transferred must have been held for\nproductive use in a trade or business or held as an investment and must be\nexchanged for property that will also be used in a trade or business or be held as\nan investment. Tax on gain is deferred until the investment or business property\nis sold and not exchanged.\nInterest Mortgage interest incurred by loans to buy, build, or materially improve a\nprimary or secondary residence is deductible from gross income, subject to\nlimitations based on the loan amount and when it was incurred . The interest on a\nhome equity loan may be deducted only if the loan is used to \u201cbuy, build or\nsubstantially improve\u201d the home that secures the loan. Principal payments on a\nloan are not deductible. Licensees should consult the latest IRS publications for\ncurrent rules on mortgage interest deduction.\nFor income properties that are held as investments, interest on debts incurred to\nfinance the investment is deductible as investment interest up to the amount of\nnet income received from the property.\nPassive activities Passive activities are business activities in which the taxpayer does not materially\nparticipate. Included are interests in limited partnerships and rental activities.\nLosses from such activities may be used to offset income from other passive\nactivities. Passive losses, with certain limitations, may be carried forward to\nfuture years or accumulated and deducted from capital gain at the time of sale.\nChapter 18: Real Estate Investment 287",

The\nanalysis includes costs, income, taxation, appreciation, and return.\nA property acquired and used as a primary residence is an example of a non-\nincome property. If a portion of a residence is used for business (i.e., a home\noffice), this portion only may be treated as an income property for tax purposes.\nSince, by definition, a non-income property does not generate income, its value\nas an investment must come from one or more of the other sources: appreciation,\nleverage, or tax benefits.\nAppreciation Appreciation is the increase in value of an asset over time. A simple way to\nestimate appreciation on a primary residence is to subtract the price originally\npaid from the estimated current market value:\nCurrent value - original price = total appreciation\nFor example, if a house was bought for $300,000 and its estimated market value\nnow is $400,000, it has appreciated by $100,000.\nOriginal price: $300,000\nCurrent market value: $400,000\nTotal appreciation: $100,000\nTotal appreciation can be stated as a percentage increase over the original price by\ndividing the estimated total appreciation by the original price.\nThe house in the last example has appreciated by 33%:\n(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b)\n=% \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\n100,000\n=33%\n300,000\nTo estimate the percentage of annual appreciation, divide the percent appreciated\nby the number of years the house has been owned:\n% \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\n=% \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\n288 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

Furthermore, depreciation\nis not allowed for non-income properties. Consult IRS publications for current\nconditions and limitations for mortgage interest deductibility.\nTax liability The seller of a principal residence may owe tax on capital gain that results from\nthe sale. The IRS defines gain on the sale of a home as amount realized from the\nsale minus the adjusted basis of the home sold.\nAmount realized. The amount realized, also known as net proceeds from sale,\nis expressed by the formula:\nsale price\n- costs of sale\namount realized\nThe sale price is the total amount the seller receives for the home. This includes\nmoney, notes, mortgages or other debts the buyer assumes as part of the sale.\nCosts of sale include brokerage commissions, relevant advertising, legal fees,\nseller-paid points and other closing costs. Certain fixing-up expenses, as\ndiscussed further below, can be deducted from the amount realized to derive an\nadjusted sale price for the purpose of postponing taxation on gain.\nFor example, Larry and Mary sold their home for $350,000. Their selling costs,\nincluding the commission they paid Broker Betty and amounts paid to inspectors,\na surveyor, and the title company, amounted to ten percent of the selling price, or\n$35,000. The amount they realized from the sale was therefore $315,000.\nAdjusted basis. Basis is a measurement of how much is invested in the property\nfor tax purposes. Assuming that the property was acquired through purchase, the\nbeginning basis is the cost of acquiring the property. Cost includes cash and debt\nobligations, and such other settlement costs as legal and recording fees, abstract\nfees, surveys, charges for installing utilities, transfer taxes, title insurance, and\nany other amounts the buyer pays for the seller.\nThe beginning basis is increased or decreased by certain types of expenditures\nmade while the property is owned. Basis is increased by the cost of capital\nimprovements made to the property. Assessments for local improvements such\nas roads and sidewalks also increase the basis. Examples of capital improvements\nare: putting on an addition, paving a driveway, replacing a roof, adding central air\nconditioning, and rewiring the home.\nChapter 18: Real Estate Investment 289",

In addition to commercial and investment properties such as office\nbuildings, this category includes residential rental properties. An important\ndifference between income and non-income properties is that deductions for\ndepreciation are allowed on income properties. Income properties, like non-\nincome properties, generate a gain (or loss) on sale, and they also create an\nannual income stream. The annual income streams are determined on both a pre-\ntax and after-tax basis in order to determine the productivity of the investment.\nPre-tax cash flow Cash flow is the difference between the amount of actual cash flowing into the\ninvestment as revenue and out of the investment for expenses, debt service, and\nall other items. Cash flow concerns cash items only, and therefore excludes\ndepreciation, which is not a cash expense Pre-tax cash flow, or cash flow before\ntaxation, is calculated as follows:\npotential rental income\n- vacancy and collection loss\n= effective rental income\n+ other income\n= gross operating income (GOI)\n- operating expenses\n- reserves\n= net operating income (NOI)\n- debt service\n= pre-tax cash flow\nChapter 18: Real Estate Investment 291",

Vacancy and collection\nloss is rental income lost because of vacancies or tenants' failure to pay rent.\nEffective rental income is the potential income adjusted for these losses. To that\nis added any other income the property generates, such as from laundry or\nparking charges, to obtain gross operating income. Operating expenses paid by\nthe landlord include such items as utilities and maintenance. These are deducted\nfrom gross operating income. Some owners also set aside a cash reserve each\nyear to build up a fund for capital replacements in the future, for example, to\nreplace a roof or a furnace. Cash reserves are not deductible for tax purposes until\nspent as deductible repairs or maintenance. The remainder is net operating\nincome (NOI). When the annual amount paid for debt service, including\nprincipal and interest, is subtracted, the remainder is the pre-tax cash flow.\nFor instance, a small office building of 3,500 square feet rents at $20 per square\nfoot. If fully rented, the annual rental income would be $70,000. Historically, the\nproperty averages $4,200 in vacancy and collection losses. Equipment rental will\nprovide an additional $2,000 per year in income. The owner will have to pay\noperating expenses amounting to ten dollars per square foot, or $35,000 per year.\nThe owner sets aside one dollar per square foot, or $3,500 per year, for reserves.\nThe owner financed the purchase of the building with a loan that requires annual\ndebt service in the amount of $20,000. The pre-tax cash flow for the building is\nillustrated in the following exhibit.\nExhibit 18.2 Pre-tax Cash Flow\npotential rental income $70,000\n- vacancy and collection loss 4,200\n= effective rental income 65,800\n+ other income 2,000\n= gross operating income (GOI) 67,800\n- operating expenses 35,000\n- reserves 3,500\n= net operating income (NOI) 29,300\n- debt service 20,000\n= pre-tax cash flow 9,300\nTax liability The owner's tax liability on taxable income from the property is based on taxable\nincome rather than cash flow. Taxable income and tax liability are calculated as\nfollows:\nnet operating income (NOI)\n+ reserves\n- interest expense\n- cost recovery expense\n= taxable income\nx tax rate\n= tax liability\nTaxable income is net operating income minus all allowable deductions. Cost\nrecovery expense is allowed as a deduction, while allowances for reserves and\n292 Principles of Real Estate Practice in Alabama",

    "text": "payments on loan principal payback are not allowed. Thus, since reserves were\ndeducted from gross operating income to determine NOI, this amount must be\nadded back in. As only the interest portion of debt service is deductible, the\nprincipal amount must be removed from the debt service payments and the\ninterest expense deducted from NOI. Taxable income, multiplied by the owner's\nmarginal tax bracket, gives the tax liability.\nNote on tax rate: when a rental property is owned as an individual or by way of a\npass-through entity (partnership, LLC treated as a partnership for tax purposes, or\nS corporation), its net income is taxed at the individual\u2019s personal marginal\nincome tax rate.
